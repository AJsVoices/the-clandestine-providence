#  Walker's Prognosis

As I headed down to the Infirmary, I sent a call to the cafeteria. The same guy
picked up who answered the last time. "How can I help you?"

"I need a pizza, some chocolate bars and mountain dew sent to the fish bowl."

"Nox?"

I laughed at the response. "Yeah, it's me again."

"Are you feeding a bunch of nerds?" He asked again. I sorta wished I knew his
name.

"Just one. She's helping me track down her boss." I answered

"What do you want on the pizza?"

"Just pepperoni, I didn't ask what she wanted, but everyone likes pepperoni
right?"

"Do you?" He asked.

"If I'm eating pizza yeah, but I'd prefer veggies on it too."

He chuckled, "Ever the health nut. I could make you a decent pie."

I recognized the ton, "I'm good thanks. I'm not much into pizza."

"I can make you whatever you want." he said.

I sighed, "Thanks, man. Really appreciate the pick up lines, makes my day right
now, but I have a boyfriend."

"Oh." He said, "I didn't mean…" He sighed, "Actually yeah I did. But it wasn't
for me really."

"Your sister? She's all up into the money and the offsite living now eh?" I
said.

He chuckled. "A little, but…"

"Don't worry about it. I'm good honest. But I need that pie and candy and soda
sent on up asap."

"I'll get right on it. Ms. Sheila also informs me that if you don't stop by
again soon she'll never be making you any bread or goodies again."

I laughed, "Tell her might might stop by for dinner then, if I'm still in the
building."

"I will. I'll add this to the bill you starting for this case?"

"Yeah, sure, why not." I said. "Thanks, man."

He hung up with little ceremony and he had been hitting on me. It wasn't his
sister. Though I think he had one. It didn't matter as I glanced at the messages
I'd sent Alex, still unanswered.

I pulled open the Infirmary level door and headed inside. I was greeted with a
busy floor. Much busier than usual. A familiar smile waved me in her direction.
"Hey." She said.

I ran my finger through her dark hair plucking out the purple strands. "I like
it."

She reached up and ruffled my ice blue tips and laughed, "I can't do what you
do, but I like it. You caused another ruckus down here."

"Sorry Madison. I had to save him."

She giggled, "I know. Everyone's down here taking a look at the new survivor of
a vampire bite. He's so popular now."

"He doing alright?" I asked.

Madison laughed as she grabbed my hand and tugged me through the crowd to
Walker's room. He sat in a bed with people standing around his room. He was
telling a story with animated gestures. "He looks dandy." I said

"He's a star. He's much more tolerable of the attention not like your father."

I rolled my eyes. "Alright, he's good. I got a Dragon to find."

Madison smiled up at me, "Arlight Nox. See you around."
