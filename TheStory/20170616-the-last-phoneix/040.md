#  Lost Phones

My apartment was empty. Even Ophelia was out. It was late by the time I actually
got to my room and crashed on the bed. I was asleep without even taking off my
shoes. I hurt in places I didn't like hurting. And the last thought I had before
drifting off to sleep was having Alex hold me.
