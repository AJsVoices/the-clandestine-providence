#  "Most of the time rehabilitate them. 80% of the cases in New York are fledglings either abandoned or neglected. Sometimes it's an unknown, rare case. I had one
girl who couldn't shift at all during the moons. Once she shifted into wolf
while the moon was full she couldn't shift out. Her tie to the moon so strong,
and her human form so weak she couldn't do it. So her family has to lock her up
for three days. She gets out on occasion and I have to find her before anyone
else."

"Aren't you afraid of getting bitten?"

"No. Not really. I'm a hunter. It's what I was trained to do. I'll die young as
most hunters do. But I'm going to live my way - not the way the Venatori say I
have to."

"Big talk for such a little man." Alex smirked.

"Little huh? I'll show you little." I bit my bottom lip. "But I don't think
that'll happen anytime soon."

"So now you aren't trying to get in my pants? I'm offended." Alex smirked as he
said it.

"My motives are still the same." I pressed a kiss to his cheek and stood up when
the train lurched to a stop at our destination. "But we have a date to get
through. And I'm looking forward to beating you at laser tag."

I headed for the door with Alex following after me. "We'll see about that pretty
boy."
