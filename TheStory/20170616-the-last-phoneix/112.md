#  Mandatory Vacation

I stood in the hallway for much too long thinking. I only knew it was too long
because Dorian found me standing there. He was smirking when I noticed him, "How
long have you been standing there?"

"About five minutes, giScene Break
 More Than I Was Looking For

I pulled the key from my pocket that I'd taken from the plastic bag of Naomi's
things. And headed up to the apartment I'd found Drake and the human in. I think
his name was Gordon but I hadn't technically met his so I didn't remember
really.

The fourth floor was empty, well save for take a few seconds." Dorian answered.

"I take it Reginald told you?" I asked.

"Last night in a meeting. It was Margo's suggestion."

"That was supposed to be a meeting about Drake, wasn't it."

"It was, and many othe homeless man sleeping under the
stair well. The stench of body odor was the only thing I could smell. It wasn't
pleasant. I unlocked the door and the soft scent of burning wood greeted me. It
was definitely a dragon den. It made me wonder what Naomi collected as i walked
through her living room. I opened myself to the patterns around, there would be
indications of hidden things in the patterns and that's what I wanted to find
since Naomi hadn't told me where things too. You did the impossible, Nox." Dorian said.

"What was that?"

"The Dragons came to us when Ye Pan died. Not the other way around. You are
forging us alliances without trying. Reginald has neve safe was, only the combination. Next time
I'll have to remember to ask.

But it wasn't hard to find, it was located behind a painting in the master
bedroom. And i didn't need the combination either I could see the pattern
without it, and if I couldn't I could just melt the hinges off anyway.

Inside there was a lot of things, more than just the USB drive. Mostly papers. I
didn't search through the papers been allowed in this
building, none of the dragonut I did move them around until I found the
drive I was looking for. That was when one of the envelopes caught my attention.
It heads."

I gave him a curious look and he laughed and answe Drake's name on it.

Inside was a Stock voucher from way back and a letter written in elegant Dragon
script. I'd learned to read the questionit along with others, but it was rusty.r things too. You did the impossible, Nox." Dorian said.

"What was that?"

"The Dragons came to us when Ye Pan died. Not the other way around. You are
forging us alliances without trying. Reginald has never been allowed in this
building, none of the dragon heads."

I gave him a curious look and he laughed and answered the question I dihadn't have
to ask. "Mark Green has always been afraid to le
used it in ages.

But I was pretty sure it read:

Dear Drake,

The Dragon has tasked me what is surely a suicide mission, but the dragons into the building
out of fear they'd kill him. It's Dragon law to kill strong Cesari. They know
when you are born. Just as it's their law to kill half dragons like Drake. But
their laws are strict, and succession must progress. Everything in order. If you
let one nether or cesari lisays it's for
the greater good and he is my leader, my mentor and everything that I know to be
true. Just as you will know yours, I know mine. I've collected many of these old
documents in my years with the Last Phoenix, and at the last appraisal it was
worth one million dollars. This should be enough to see you well off in life, go
to college and start a family in the even the remainder life until he or she dies."

"I know the law. But why do we have Cesari?"

Dorian smiled. "Why do you think Mark Green is leader?"

"He's the strongest Cesari of his generation."

"Nox, he was the strongest of all generations, until you were born. Did you ever
wonder why your power wat I'm not around to see you through
it. Should you need it The Golden Clan offers sanctuary to netherdragons like
you. They can teach you. Know that I love you baby boy. I'm sorry I couldn't be
there for you.

Love your mama

I folded the letter up and stuck it back in the envelope. I pulled out the rest
of the papers and carefully stacked them together being careful not to damage
any of them. I had found Naomi's hoard. I wondered what she had here and if any
of it needed to be returned to its rightful owner. I'd have to do the research
before making any decisions.

I found a document case so much greater than that of Mark Greens?"

I shook my headitting on a desk full of more old things and put what I
had in the safe inside and took it all. It was all Drake's and he was going to
be mine. "I didn't think about it. Figured it had to do with my ability
to see the patterns so easily."

Dorian shrugged, "That's part of it, but your power is astronomically greater
than a 5 Nox. You shouldn't exist."

I laughed, "Sounds very much like my life."

Dorianfeel any guilt about taking them. The Venatori would likely
just burn the place down, everything else inside.

Drake's small room was down the hall. I could smell his soft smokey scent and
stood staring at the all the small things, a bed, a dresser, toys all over the
floor. I didn't know how i was groinned, "I know son. But because the Dragon controlled you, everyone
believes you need to take a break. Wrap your head around it all. Think of it
like paid leave of absence, or what the police officers get when they kill a
person. Go take a vacation with Ag to do this. How was I going to take care of
him? How was I going to get through this mess? I took a few pictures of the room
with my phone and then grabbed a bag and stuff the toy car collection into it. I
found another to stuff his clothes into. The only two things left that showed
use was the blue blanket and the ragged snoopy dog. Both which I carried in my
arms. I looked like I was going on vacation. Or moving out. But Drake was.

My stomach rumbve the remainder life until he or she dies."

"I know the law. But why do we have Cesari?"

Dorian smiled. "Why do you think Mark Green is leader?"

"He's the strongest Cesari of his generation."

"Nox, he was the strongest of all generations, until you were born. Did you ever
wonder why your power was so much greater than that of Mark Greens?"

I shook my head. "I didn't think about it. Figured it had to do with my ability
to see the patterns so easily."

Dorian shrugged, "That's part of it, but your power is astronomically greater
than a 5 Nox. You shouldn't exist."

I laughed, "Sounds very much like my life."

Dorian grinned, "I know son. But because the Dragon controlled you, everyone
believes you need to take a break. Wrap your head around it all. Think of it
like paid leave of absence, or what the police officers get when they kill a
person. Go take a vacation with Alexd and your brothers. Find some down time."

"I'm fine."

"You are Nox. I see it. But you just had a lot of things drop on you. You just
moved, you've a three year old coming,I realized I hadn't eaten anything today. I'd had coffee
but that was it. My day was such a fucking mess. But I felt a little better
after having two heart to heart conversations. I'm sure Ant and I would later,
and Sage would probably try two sixteen year old boys to tend to, and
a new boyfriend." Dorian grinned, "A boyfriend!" He rolled his eyes, "I'd never
thought I'd see that day. Two weeks - mandatory. I don'get me to talk about it too. Tomorrow was my
birthday. What the fuck was I going to do all fucking day by myself. I was
pretty sure Alex wasn't talking me. But I stopped in to one of my local lunch
places and grabbed a sandwich. I sat down at want to see you in the
AU building at all Nox. Not a foot inside."

I sighed but nodded. "Alright, I guess I can manage that."

Dorian took me by the shoulders and turned me arou outside table with a bottle of
water.

The sandwich was a usual, chicken salad on rye, light mayo with tomatoes and
avocado. Like everywhere else, I can in regularly and ate the same thing. It
made me think of Alex and th two sixteen year old boys to tend to, and
a new boyfriend." Dorian grinned, "A boyfriend!" He rolled his eyes, "I'd never
thought I'd see that day. Two weeks - mandatory. I don't want to see you in the
AU building at all Nox. Not a foot inside."

I sighed but nodded. "Alright, I guess I can manage that."

Dorian took me by the shoulders and turned me around towards the stairs and
p he had accushed me, "Now go. I want to see a tan boy."

I sighed as I walked. I wasn't going to sit around and do nothing. I could lie
in bed with Alex… I wanted to see him. But he hadn't gotten back to me at all,
but I sent him a text anyway. Maybe he'd answer this time.

N: I have two weeks off, maybe we can spend some of it together - Naked in a bed
sounds pretty good to me. of being selfish. Of the things
we'd fought about. I sighed as I opened up my text messages and saw no response
from Alex. But it didn't stop me from sending him another one.

N: The joys of childhood. Look at the mess in my future. \<image of cars and
toys scattered across the floor\>

Tony said to uncomplicate me. There was only one way to uncomplicate me, as
Dorian would say, write it all down. I opened up a new doc on my phone and
stared at the page. I titled it. 'All The Things You Wish You Knew About Nox
Sétanta' and that was as far as I got before my phone rang.
