# My Own Prince
My time was all fucked up.  It was late and I wasn't tired.  I didn't want to go to sleep.  I didn't want to find myself floating in the darkness looking for the pair of brown eyes I just couldn't shake.  So I found myself at the bar nursing my second Jameson Gold Reserve in the hotel bar.  I wasn't surprised when someone sat down next to me.  The bar wasn't crowded, but some times people didn't like to look like they were sitting alone when they were.  I didn't care either way.  Later I'd crash and hopefully the pretty boy from my dreams would be long past waking and I wouldn't have to worry about him.  I don't know why I was worrying about him, but I was.

The man next to me wasn't overly large and he had that Mediterranean quality to him with the dark skin, hair
