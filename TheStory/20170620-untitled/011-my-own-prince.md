# My Own Prince
My time was all fucked up.  It was late and I wasn't tired.  I didn't want to go to sleep.  I didn't want to find myself floating in the darkness looking for the pair of brown eyes I just couldn't shake.  So I found myself at the bar nursing my second Jameson Gold Reserve in the hotel bar.  I wasn't surprised when someone sat down next to me.  The bar wasn't crowded, but some times people didn't like to look like they were sitting alone when they were.  I didn't care either way.  Later I'd crash and hopefully the pretty boy from my dreams would be long past waking and I wouldn't have to worry about him.  I don't know why I was worrying about him, but I was.

The man next to me wasn't overly large and he had that Mediterranean quality to him with the dark skin, hair and eyes.  I turned to look at him and frowned the moment I got a good look at his face.  Fuck me!

The man smirked.  "You know you have very loud thoughts."

"Do all of you fucking read minds?"  I groaned out as I took a long gulp of my whiskey.  What the fuck was the Prince of New York doing in Vegas?

"No, well yeah.  My kind do.  Not all do though."  He said flatly.  "He doesn't know you are here does he?"

I looked over at Anthony Giovanni, fucking son of Il Cane and one of Nox's fuck buddies. "Who?"

The vampire sighed.  "Doesn't matter.  You just proved me right though.  I'm kinda glad you're here now."  He said as he got up from the stool and dropped a hundred on the bar, he hadn't even ordered.  "Stay away from him.  I'm going to have to pick up all the fucking pieces again, if there is anything left when I get back."

"Who the fuck are you talking about?"  I asked.

He blinked at me, "Really?  You already forgot his name.  Classic.  Just stay away from Nox, Mr. Hutton."

I don't know why I was so surprised he was talking about Nox.  I was surprised I didn't think of it.  Maybe those few drinks really had gone to my head.  "He doesn't need me anyway.  Dorian said since he last saw me he has been doing great."  I downed the last of the whiskey and waved for a refill.

Giovanni shook his head and walked back over to me and leaned against the bar between the stool he'd been sitting in and me and spoke in a quiet voice, "Nox is only doing great because he found a way to work out his problems without drinking or getting high when his life tumbles out of control.  And he found that way because he was about to meet a pair of blue fucking eyes he was in love with.  Those blue eyes broke him into tiny little pieces and he worked his ass off putting those pieces back together only so you could shred him again into tiny little bits 5 years later.  He's all Ant, give him a chance.  But here you sit three thousand miles away while he just wants to have lunch.  Fucking piece of work."

"Why the fuck should I care?  He's got you to pick him up."

The vampire smirked at me showing off his pointed fangs.  "Oh, I don't know because he fucking loves you.  But hey I'm sure the fifty thousand texts he's sent you I'm sure tell you nothing."  

The vampire walked away from me with a growl.  I reached out and tried to grab him but he was already out of my range of motion.  I stumbled as I got off the stool and he caught me.  "Fuck! Man.  Just sit down and leave it alone.  Or better yet go to bed."

"I'm fine.  And if I go to sleep I'll try to find **him**."
