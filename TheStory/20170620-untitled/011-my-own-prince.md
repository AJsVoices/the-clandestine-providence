# My Own Prince
My time was all fucked up.  It was late and I wasn't tired.  I didn't want to go to sleep.  I didn't want to find myself floating in the darkness looking for the pair of brown eyes I just couldn't shake.  So I found myself at the bar nursing my second Jameson Gold Reserve in the hotel bar.  I wasn't surprised when someone sat down next to me.  The bar wasn't crowded, but some times people didn't like to look like they were sitting alone when they were.  I didn't care either way.  Later I'd crash and hopefully the pretty boy from my dreams would be long past waking and I wouldn't have to worry about him.  I don't know why I was worrying about him, but I was.

The man next to me wasn't overly large and he had that Mediterranean quality to him with the dark skin, hair and eyes.  I turned to look at him and frowned the moment I got a good look at his face.  Fuck me!

The man smirked.  "You know you have very loud thoughts."

"Do all of you fucking read minds?"  I groaned out as I took a long gulp of my whiskey.  What the fuck was the Prince of New York doing in Vegas?

"No, well yeah.  My kind do.  Not all do though."  He said flatly.  "He doesn't know you are here does he?"

I looked over at Anthony Giovanni, fucking son of Il Cane and one of Nox's fuck buddies. "Who?"

The vampire sighed.  "Doesn't matter.  You just proved me right though.  I'm kinda glad you're here now."  He said as he got up from the stool and dropped a hundred on the bar, he hadn't even ordered.  "Stay away from him.  I'm going to have to pick up all the fucking pieces again, if there is anything left when I get back."

"Who the fuck are you talking about?"  I asked.

He blinked at me, "Really?  You already forgot his name.  Classic.  Just stay away from Nox, Mr. Hutton."

I don't know why I was so surprised he was talking about Nox.  I was surprised I didn't think of it.  Maybe those few drinks really had gone to my head.  "He doesn't need me anyway.  Dorian said since he last saw me he has been doing great."  I downed the last of the whiskey and waved for a refill.

Giovanni shook his head and walked back over to me and leaned against the bar between the stool he'd been sitting in and me and spoke in a quiet voice, "Nox is only doing great because he found a way to work out his problems without drinking or getting high when his life tumbles out of control.  And he found that way because he was about to meet a pair of blue fucking eyes he was in love with.  Those blue eyes broke him into tiny little pieces and he worked his ass off putting those pieces back together only so you could shred him again into tiny little bits 5 years later.  He's all Ant, give him a chance.  But here you sit three thousand miles away while he just wants to have lunch.  Fucking piece of work."

"Why the fuck should I care?  He's got you to pick him up."

The vampire smirked at me showing off his pointed fangs.  "Oh, I don't know because he fucking loves you.  But hey I'm sure the fifty thousand texts he's sent you I'm sure tell you nothing."  

The vampire walked away from me with a growl.  I reached out and tried to grab him but he was already out of my range of motion.  I stumbled as I got off the stool and he caught me.  "Fuck! Man.  Just sit down and leave it alone.  Or better yet go to bed."

"I'm fine.  And if I go to sleep I'll try to find **him**. I'm not drunk."  I protested.  "I tripped over the bar stool because I was in a hurry."

He laughed.  I stood staring at him as he laughed at me.  "Dude, if you could see yourself.  Look, Nox is fine.  I promise you.  He's been dealing with his nightmares since he was six years old.  And if you truly have been dreaming with him for all those years you have to know that.  His nightmares got worse after you didn't show up.  Like ten times worse.  And he'd probably have a shit ton more scars if he hadn't learned how to heal his wounds.  He's not better off without you, even if I think you're a douche."  He grinned at me with that smile that I knew was a joke, but normally I'd hear the truth of the matter, but I didn't hear him at all.

"Why can't I read you at all?"  I asked.

Giovanni sat down next to me again and shrugged.  "We were taught to shield ourselves.  Not all of us can, but if you live and breathe you can do it."

"Vampires aren't living and breathing creatures."  I said flatly.

"Sure they are.  I was born a vampire.  Most vampires are made, but I was born this way.  The need for blood is strong, and I can't live off of human food alone but I can for a short time.  Blood fuels our magic, we don't make our own.  I don't breathe like you, but I do breathe."  He said.  I was way too drunk to understand so I just nodded my head.

"How do you do it?" I asked as I picked up the Jameson and the fucking vampire prince plucked it from my fingers and downed it in one gulp.  "Fucker!  That was mine."

He grabbed the back of my jacket and I knew there would be wrinkles I'd have to get out later.  "Watch the jacket!"  He patted my back and rubbed out the wrinkles even as he pushed me through the doors and out into the fresh air.  He lead me down the sidewalk through the strip.  It really was nice out here.

"I don't do anything.  Nox does it all.  He just needs time and patience from his family and friends.  I mean it's great when I get to kick the shit out of him.  But he gives as good as he gets.  I make him work his body.  His brothers make him feel loved.  Dorian gives him something to do.  Margo makes him talk.  And when I say make, I don't me it's a forced thing, he just responds to certain things.  Fuck, for all the mess he's been since he met you again, he's been happier."

"All we do is fight.  He doesn't fight with you. How the fuck can he be happier."  I growled at him.

"Why do you think he likes me in any way other than a friend?" He stopped so suddenly and pushed me into an alleyway.  I didn't like this at all.

"He wanted you.  He told me.  When he first met you.  He wanted you to bite him, and he wanted to fuck you.  He came to me in the dream with your fucking love bite on his neck."

The smirk on Ant's face I wanted to punch.  "You think he wants to fuck me?"  He laughed.  "Oh, fuck.  You're jealous."  He continued to snicker and laugh and I rolled my eyes and pushed him away.  He stumbled away still laughing and I walked away.  Fucking vampires.

In the span of a blink of an eye and mid step The Prince of New York had his arms wrapped around me.  He pushed past my shields and I heard, no I felt the pull of lust towards the man holding me.  He pushed past my defenses and I leaned my head to the side willingly.  I wanted him to bite me.

I slammed my shields down and the vampire
