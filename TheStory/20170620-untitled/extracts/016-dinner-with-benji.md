Benji headed for the door and opened it.  I heard Benji jump.  "How long have you been there?"

I stepped towards the door to see who was there, but Benji was blocking the view.  "Who's there Benji?"  I asked as I approached and once I got there I pushed Benji to the side and there standing in front of my hotel room door was a pair of brown eyes holding flowers in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other dressed in the same outfit his brother had posted earlier that afternoon.
