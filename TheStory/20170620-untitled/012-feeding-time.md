# Feeding Time 
I vaguely remember Nox making a joke like that, I thought he was with werewolves at the time.  I don't remember.  Didn't matter as Ant, that's what Nox called him, and he called himself when referencing .. I could too?  It was better that way, though he wasn't my friend.  Ant dragged me after him.  "I'll show you."

We walked through the strip and down a side street then down an alley and I was getting more and more uncomfortable as we walked.  "Don't shake hands, don't make eye contact and definitely never say yes to anyone in here, no matter what you think they are asking.  I don't have you collared and I don't have you marked, so anyone will think you are fair game and there is only so much protecting I can do in Vegas without calling down the ire of the city's prince."

Yeah that was what I needed to have Abraham mad at me even before he found out I was conning him.  I followed closely on the tall  Italian vampires heels and I saw the reaction to people standing near by.  The women and even the men that I could read were all lured to him.  Their eyes drawn to him but once he was away whatever vampire they were being seduced by pulled their attention back.  And I only knew they were vampires because I couldn't read them.

We were at some sort of rave.  The music was loud and there were a ton of people.  Ant stopped at a bar and ordered me a whiskey.  "Don't order yourself.  You are mine for all intensive purposes if anyone asks.  But you should be safe here."

I didn't know what to say. But he slipped off into the crowd and I watched as he came on to a man.  It wasn't so much as he came on to him as the man thrust himself at him.  There were other people doing the same.  Every vampire in the room was glaring at him.  I even heard whispers, "Asshole.  Stealing our people."  Some even swore to his face and he just smiled at them.  It wasn't apologetic but no one made a move against him.  

But Ant dragged the man back to him, it wasn't so much as dragging as the man hung on him.  The vampire and his prey stood in front of me.  He turned the man to look at him, "Do you want me to bite you?"

"Yes."  The words came out breathless.  

"Answer a few questions and I'll gladly pay your price."   He said.  He looked at me and smiled, "You can read him?"

I nodded, though I didn't know why he wanted me to, but he didn't wait for me to ask as he looked at the man again.  "Do you like men?"

"Fuck no.  But I like you.  Please feed?"  The man begged as he tilted his head to the side.   But inside he was shaking.  I don't know why I let Marcus talk me into this.  I don't want to be here.

I hook my head, "He doesn't want to be here."

Ant smirked, "Perfect."  Ant looked deep into the man's eyes and Ant spoke slowly and clearly, "You  never met me.  You don't want to be here, go home to your family and forget about today."

"So why did you bring me here?"
