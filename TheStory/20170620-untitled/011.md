#  Making New Friends (Alex)

The games ended and I doubled wConfrontations (Alex)

N: I'm sorry I left like that. I had started with while still not actually
looking like Ijust need time to wrap my head rigged the game. The dealer didn't know maround things. I
know selfish, but I have sto it wasn't a
matter of Benji telling him. For all he knew we were all cheating. And most of
us were. The guy to mydo what I have to do. Maybe we can get together for
lunch tomorrow? I'll cook. (Jun 20, 2017 8:11AM)

N: I just thought I'd left was counting the cards. Theyou know that I was heading down two vampires were
telepathic like myself, but the texan next to me, he was legit, and oddly enough
he won more often than not. But usually becauseDrake's apartment
to pick up some of his things. You think he'd like anything special? (Jun 20,

N: The joys of childhood. Look at the rmest of us knew our hands
were shit.

It was in my future. \<image of cars and
toys scattered across thell late, and I knew my pretty boy would be fast asleep by now. Probably
even about to wake up. I glanced at my watch and nodded to myself, he was about
to wake up for the day and  floor\> (Jun 20, 2017 1:15PM)

N: New Place got approved. I'm moving out. I'll text you the address soon as I
learn it. (I hadven't even gone to bed.

Both of the vampires strode up next to me as I headed out of the basement into
the darkened sky. Though it was almost as bright as daylightlooked yet.) \<image of packing boxes scattered across the

N: Drake says hi. He has his own the strip.
Brandon Holt grinned at me, "So, you played a good game. Lu can't be happy about
that." Lu? I thought to myself. But the darker vampire kept on talking. "His
house never loses."

I laughed. "Teach him right. Stiffing me like last time."

The other vampire, the Prince of Las Vegas chuckled. "So you've had not so great
run ins with him in the past?"

I nodded. "Yeah. Stiffs me whenever he gets a chance. Last time he hired a broad
to distract me." Ironic that this was a distraction from a guy.

"He listens in when he shouldn't." Brandon cursed. "Maybe you can help?"

"How can I help?" I asked. "I have nothing more than money to lose to him." I
played hard to get, though my pretty boy never would. He was a straight arrow,
he knew exactly what he wanted. Though he still had to ask for permission. Which
got annoying.

"Do you believe in magic?" The prince asked.

I shrugged, "I don't know. What do you mean magic?" I couldn't help the smile
inside. Did I believe in magic, fuck yes. I watched my boy disappear with my own
eyes. I saw balls of fire floating around. I was a dream walker and a fucking
telepath the answer was a resounding yes. But I let my skepticism ride my
surface thoughts andSnoopy Dance. \<image of Nox and Drake\>

N: Look what I got. Address is on the layout. Got enough space for you and Drake
and then some. \<image of address and apartment layout\> (Jun 20, 7:14PM)

N: Checkout my view. \<image of the night time sky overlooking the river from
Nox's balcony\> (Jun 20, 10:38PM)

N: We still on for lunch? (Jun 21, 6:16AM)

A: Can't do lunch. See you around, pretty boy. (Jun 21, 6:27PM)

N: You'd be at home. \<image of the flat screen TV on the wall and one of Nox's
empty closet\> (June 21, 9:34AM)

N: Your doorman is awesome. I had him deliver your box to your apartment. I
intended to give them to you five years ago, but you never showed up. I didn't
mean to keep them. I just wanted proof of who I was. I have so many questions
about they both laughed a little. I let slip a juicy tidbit about
or proprietor Lu and his lust for young prostitutes. Which was an absolute lie
and Benj would kill me but fuck Toto made me play the game with mind reading
vampires.

"My name is Abraham." The prince said. It was finally nice to get a name to the
face I'd been staring at all night. The bald head and the goatee were a little
off putting but he was a big scary mother fucker and he was a vampire. "And I
just read that Lu likes young girls. I think we can manage something with that."

I looked wide eyed at them bothx. Maybe you'll let me ask those questions sometime. (Jun 21,

N: Look what you are missing. \<image of bacon, eggs, toast and cinnamon rolls\>
(Jun 22, 4:45AM)

N: I'm going to come over, I need to talk to you. (Jun 22, 6:13PM)

N: Need to talk. Are you okay? Just saw your fake friend, what a piece of work!

[[ After Benji read the texts ]]

N: Margo is helping me remember my dreams. I remember our first kiss, and mouthed, howâ€¦ And they both did the wall-la
motion and magic. I shook my head and thought of a huge number, "What number am
I thinking?" It was a cr
first time - both my firsts if you can count a dream encounter. (Jun 22,
10:55PM)

N: I'm so sornry classic stereotypicI don't remember all thing to do and would so piss
off Nox but he'd do it just to piss them off. It made me smile inside. Pissing
off my pretty boy just to see him steam a little. Fuck this wasn't working so
well. I missed him.

Brandon shook his head, "Three billion, four hundred thousand and three."

"No way?" I drawled out dumbfounded.

Holt looked at me with those dark eyes and I knew he was weighing me. He handed
me a business card, "Meet us tomorrow at 6:45pm and we'll go over how you can
help us."

I took the card and his fingers brushed mine and there was a cold chill
throughout my body. I was fucking in with vampires.

ose times. I wish I did. I hate thinking
about what you had to think of me back then. (Jun 22, 10:55PM)

N: I want to remember all of them. Please help me. (Jun 22, 10:55PM)

N: Alex, I'm worried something's happened to you please call or text. Any hour.
