# Real Food
The vampire looked at me as my stomach rumbled.  "There's an all you can eat breakfast buffet around the corner."

"I know that." I growled at him.  This was my town.

Ant smirked, "You're cute when you're angry."  He laughed.  "I don't mean that in the I'll fuck you sort of way, either.  Like puppy dog cute."

I glare at him.  He was making fun of me.  Not that I could blame him I was acting a child.  "Fine."  I lead the way to the diner around the corner and we took a seat in the empty booth by the door.  "You eat real food?"

"Your boyfriend cooks what do you think?"  He asked as he looked at the menu.

"He's not my boyfriend."  I growled.
