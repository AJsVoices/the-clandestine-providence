# Real Food
The vampire looked at me as my stomach rumbled.  "There's an all you can eat breakfast buffet around the corner."

"I know that." I growled at him.  This was my town.

Ant smirked, "You're cute when you're angry."  He laughed.  "I don't mean that in the I'll fuck you sort of way, either.  Like puppy dog cute."

I glare at him.  He was making fun of me.  Not that I could blame him I was acting a child.  "Fine."  I lead the way to the diner around the corner and we took a seat in the empty booth by the door.  "You eat real food?"

"Your boyfriend cooks what do you think?"  He asked as he looked at the menu.

"He's not my boyfriend."  I growled.

The vampire across from me just nodded his head, "Uh huh."  He set the plastic coated paper down on the table and waited patiently for our waitress.  He stared at me with those dark eyes and that smirk.  I wondered what he was thinking.  And in that moment I felt him inside my head.  Not like digging but I was inside his, but it was strange.  I lowered my menu and looked at him quizzically.

His smirk grew wider, "You wanted to know what I was thinking."  _A stray thought lingered, Blondie better not take too long to to order I'm starving.  Fucking lucky I didn't bite him._

"You want to bite me?"

Ant shook his head.  "No, I'm hungry.  And I feed before I left
