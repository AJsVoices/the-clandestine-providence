# Real Food
The vampire looked at me as my stomach rumbled.  "There's an all you can eat breakfast buffet around the corner."

"I know that." I growled at him.  This was my town.

Ant smirked, "You're cute when you're angry."  He laughed.  "I don't mean that in the I'll fuck you sort of way, either.  Like puppy dog cute."

I glare at him.  He was making fun of me.  Not that I could blame him I was acting a child.  "Fine."  I lead the way to the diner around the corner and we took a seat in the empty booth by the door.  "You eat real food?"

"Your boyfriend cooks what do you think?"  He asked as he looked at the menu.

"He's not my boyfriend."  I growled.

The vampire across from me just nodded his head, "Uh huh."  He set the plastic coated paper down on the table and waited patiently for our waitress.  He stared at me with those dark eyes and that smirk.  I wondered what he was thinking.  And in that moment I felt him inside my head.  Not like digging but I was inside his, but it was strange.  I lowered my menu and looked at him quizzically.

His smirk grew wider, "You wanted to know what I was thinking."  _A stray thought lingered, Blondie better not take too long to to order I'm starving.  Fucking lucky I didn't bite him._

"You want to bite me?"

Ant shook his head.  "No, I'm hungry.  And I feed before I left so I'm good, but that doesn't eliminate the need to fuel my body while I work."

"I'm work?"  

"No.  You are a fucking coincidence.  A theif stole something from my mother, and the guy who was holding it doesn't want mother to know so while she's in Italy incommunicado he asked me to get it.  And with Jack gone, I needed help so I asked Nox.  He found the answer in hours and sent me here.  He still thinks you are avoiding him in New York.  Doesn't even think you left, he's a fool."  Ant sighed.   "I should go."

I should have let him go.  "Benji said the same thing.  It's over."

"He doesn't think so."

The waitress chose that moment to come over with a pot of burnt coffee and I frowned.  "Can I help you dears?"

Ant looked at her, "Two breakfast specials."

I glared at him and he grinned, "That's for me, I'm not ordering for you."

I looked at the skinny red head and smiled at her, "I'll have pancakes and strawberry icecream and large order of fries."  She didn't blink but when I turned my attention back to the vampire he was smirking. 

"He's gotta fucking love feeding you, all those carbs and sugar and fat."

I smirked.  "He loved feeding me."

"And you loved eating."  Ant patted his tummy and laughed.

"Fuck you!"  I growled.

"He alright?" I asked stupidly.  I didn't care.  I didn't want to know.

Ant shrugged.  "He was. Rider and Laker were with him.  And Sage and Mia spent the first night with him."

"First night?" I sighed.  I shouldn't care but a pang of jealousy hit at the mention of his childhood friends.  "Why did they stay?"

"Nox got a new place.  He's freaking the fuck out about it.  It's big and empty and if it weren't for his brothers he'd probably be sitting in a corner trying to keep himself sane."

"See he doesn't need me."  I said.

Ant shook his head, "You really are an idiot.  He doesn't own much, but what he does he made sure there was room for you in his life.  Fucking over half the closet is empty when he could have spread things out.  The drawers were cleared.  He wanted a life with you.  He'll be devastated for months, if I can pull him out of it at all."
 
 "Are you trying to make me feel bad for him?"

Ant laughed.  "No man.  I'm just talking.   Why here?"

"Benji needed help."  I lied.  

Ant nodded, "Uh huh."  And then he
