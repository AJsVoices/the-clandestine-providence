# Dinner with Benji
I didn't have anything else for the night that required James Hutton to be dressed.  Nor did I have any plans which means after I showered and was in sweats and a t-shirt I was flipping through Laker River's social media accounts.  He wasn't nearly as prolific as his brother - probably having to do with the fact he was hiding the fact that he was with a boy.  Rider had had posted a picture of them kissing good-bye after their lunch.  The boys were fighting over the picture publicly which was mildly entertaining.

But short of the one picture that I'd seen when they arrived there had been no more pictures of my pretty boy.  But there were plenty of them before that.  I was stalking his brothers but I couldn't make myself read his text messages.  

The knock at the door signaled that food had arrived and right behind it was Benji.  He grinned at me like he knew something I didn't but he was as tight as a ship.  I wondered how much it would take to sink that ship and he'd spill whatever tidbit of knowledge he had.

Benji asked, "So how'd it go?"  The lit in his voice was so much more than what he was asking about only adding to my curiousity.

"Fine."  I said, "I guess.  A meeting tomorrow for him to show me and my employer the goods."

Benji laughed.  "So who you taking.  Which vampire prince is your boss?"

I shrugged and grabbed some wings and fries and headed for the table to sit down.  Benji followed me dragging the stool by the bed over to sit on.  "There is a perfectly good chair here."

"I know, this is more comfortable."  He said as he sat down with his own food and grabbed the remote and found his way to some new movie I hadn't seen yet.  

The movie started and Benji glanced at the door and frowned.  "What's wrong?"

Benji shook his head and looked back at me.  "Nothing."  But yet he was still locking me out of his head.  "They why the silence?"

"You need to hear my every thought?"  He asked with mock anger.

"Yeah, maybe."  You are acting weird.

Benji shook his head.  "I expect your vampire friends to show up any time.  They know I'm here right?"

I nodded, "Yeah, but
