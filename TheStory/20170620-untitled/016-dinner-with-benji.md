# Dinner with Benji
I didn't have anything else for the night that required James Hutton to be dressed.  Nor did I have any plans which means after I showered and was in sweats and a t-shirt I was flipping through Laker River's social media accounts.  He wasn't nearly as prolific as his brother - probably having to do with the fact he was hiding the fact that he was with a boy.  Rider had had posted a picture of them kissing good-bye after their lunch.  The boys were fighting over the picture publicly which was mildly entertaining.

But short of the one picture that I'd seen when they arrived there had been no more pictures of my pretty boy.  But there were plenty of them before that.  I was stalking his brothers but I couldn't make myself read his text messages.  

The knock at the door signaled that food had arrived and right behind it was Benji.  He grinned at me like he knew something I didn't but he was as tight as a ship.  I wondered how much it would take to sink that ship and he'd spill whatever tidbit of knowledge he had.

Benji asked, "So how'd it go?"  The lit in his voice was so much more than what he was asking about only adding to my curiousity.

"Fine."  I said, "I guess.  A meeting tomorrow for him to show me and my employer the goods."

Benji laughed.  "So who you taking.  Which vampire prince is your boss?"

I glared at him as Benji uncovered the trays of food to reveal a plethora of finger foods.  "There's a movie we can watch unless you have something better to do."

I shrugged and grabbed some wings and fries and headed for the table to sit down.  Benji followed me dragging the stool by the bed over to sit on.  "There is a perfectly good chair here."

"I know, this is more comfortable."  He said as he sat down with his own food and grabbed the remote and found his way to some new movie I hadn't seen yet.  

The movie started and Benji glanced at the door and frowned.  "What's wrong?"

Benji shook his head and looked back at me.  "Nothing."  But yet he was still locking me out of his head.  "They why the silence?"

"You need to hear my every thought?"  He asked with mock anger.

"Yeah, maybe."  You are acting weird.

Benji shook his head.  "I expect your vampire friends to show up any time.  They know I'm here right?"

I nodded, "Yeah, but they will wait till this book deal is done.  That's what you overheard wasn't it?"

Benji turned and stared at me, "Uh.  Yeah."

"Abraham has been all on edge thinking you'd steal the book from under him."  I smirked, "But I'm going to steal it from him.  I need your help.  Want to pretend to be my employer?"  I asked.

Benji sat up straighter and looked at me.  "Working a con together?  For the same purpose?"  Benji laughed, "You sure you can trust me?"

"I don't know anyone I'd trust more!"  I said emphatically.  He was the only person I truly trusted anymore.  I didn't even trust my pretty boy this much.

We sat in silence while we watched the movie.  Benji shifted to the bed after eating and was sprawled all over my bed.  About an hour in Benji asked, "Did you ditch your phone?  I expected your lover boy to keep pinging you.  It'd gotten worse the last few days."

I shrugged.  "It's on the nightstand where it always is."  I said and looked over and then realized it wasn't there.  I had a momentary panic attack until I remembered I'd left it on the bed.  I nodded in the direction of the bed, "It's under the comforter I guess.  You covered it up."

Benji flipped it back and grabbed the phone and took a look at it.  "You locked it."

I smirked, "Now you can keep away from him so I can forget him."

Benji sighed, "You really want to forget him, after all this time you think you can?"

I sighed.  "That's my goal.  I should go find someone else to hook up with - prove it to you."

"But you won't."  Benji said quickly.  "Will you?"  He covered nicely.  I didn't know why he was acting so strange but I didn't ask him either.

The credits started rolling and Benji grabbed my wrist and looked at the time.  "I should get home.  I got a game in about an hour.  You coming?"

I shook my head, "No, I'm tired of all the fucking smoke.  I just want to do something else."

Benji nodded, "Suit yourself.  We'll plan in the morning?"

I nodded, "Sounds great."

Benji headed for the door and opened it.  I heard Benji jump.  "How long have you been there?"

I stepped towards the door to see who was there, but Benji was blocking the view.  "Who's there Benji?"  I asked as I approached and once I got there I pushed Benji to the side and there standing in front of my hotel room door was a pair of brown eyes holding flowers in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other dressed in the same outfit his brother had posted earlier that afternoon.
