# My  Nightmares
Only one word ran through my head -  Fuck!  "You're friend left?"

I shook my head.  "He's not my friend, but yeah he left.  Feed it to the homeless do whatever you want he paid for more than what we both ordered."  I sighed as I slide out of the booth and headed for the door.  I was so done with people walking out on me.

What the fuck was The Wicked Truth doing as Nox's friend?  He'd said it cost extra because he had to use someone - just plain Fuck!  And they both knew.  What the fuck?

I didn't run but I didn't walk either.  At least it felt like I was in panic mode.  I had a bag in Serenity ready to go.  I had work out new IDs without the Wicked Truth.  I had to get the fuck out of Dodge.  Too many people knew the truth.  Knew who Alex Kennedy was.  I should burn my reality down this time.  No one had ever put the real together with the fake.  But then I had never used Alex Kennedy with a con before.  Fuck!

By the  time I'd reached my room I was ready to burn down my life.  But I got to my door and Benji was stepping inside with his key card looking both directions before slipping in.  I couldn't leave him to deal with these vampires alone.  But I couldn't stay here either.  Anthony Giovanni would eventually see Nox and he'd fucking tell him everything.

I pushed open the door to my room just before it closed and Benji was staring at me, "You are a fucking mess I heard you coming."

"You'd be a mess too if you fucked up like I did."

Benji laughed, "What you finally regretting leaving New York and your brown eyed beau?"

"What?  No!"  I shook my head and snatched my phone from him.  "He's better off without me."  I said.  I opened up his best friends instagram.  I hadn't been stalking her at all.  In the first three photos were pictures of her daughter happily playing with the blonde douche back from Aspect, but in the forth was Nox sitting on his balcony holding the little girl in his lap rocking her.  He was calm and collected and staring out into the night time sky.  I held the image out for Benji to see.  "See, he doesn't need me.  His brothers are posting all sorts of pictures of him too.  I think Mia linked to them.  And Sage has more.  Fucking doesn't need me."

"You haven't read his texts yet have you?"

I shook my head.  "I'm just going to delete them.  It's over, Benji."  I growled at him.  "Why can't anyone get that through their fucking heads."

Benji sighed and grabbed my phone from me and when I grabbed for it he held out his hand blocked me from my own phone as he opened my messages with one hand.
