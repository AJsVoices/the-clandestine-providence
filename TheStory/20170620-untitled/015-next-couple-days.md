# Next Couple Days
We fell into a rhythm over the next couple of days.  I slept until noon, Benji and I had lunch to discuss our plans.  I met with Abraham - the vampire prince of Vegas at a little past dusk for the past three days.  We came up with this brilliant plan to get back at Benji.  I was supposed to make nice.  Pay him whatever I owed him - which was nothing.  He'd scammed me after all, but I still owed him money.  I had missed that part in the breifing.  

Abraham gave me the funds and I was to play nice with Benji.  So that made us getting together all that much easier all part of the game.

Meanwhile Benji still hadn't told me what he overheard.  We were in the hotel bar, Benji had been going on about Nox and the missed messages, which had gotten a lot more frequent over the past few days.  Like he was bored or something.  I still hadn't read them.

So I left with the distinct feeling of a pair of brown eyes on my back.  And all I heard was Benji laughing so I didn't know if I'd heard him or not.  I swear it was Nox who I'd seen.

Deacon and I were meeting at another bar in another casino.  I didn't want a vampire grunt anywhere near my place of stay so I was alright with that.  Turned out the man was pure human - a thief but still human.  He had an uncanny ability to sneak around wherever he wanted.  My gut said he had some sort of path ability that I was certain my pretty boy could tell me about.  Fucking invisibility or something.  This fucking world was mind blowing.
