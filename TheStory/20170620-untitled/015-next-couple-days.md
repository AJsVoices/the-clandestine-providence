# Next Couple Days
We fell into a rhythm over the next couple of days.  I slept until noon, Benji and I had lunch to discuss our plans.  I'd met with Abraham - the vampire prince of Vegas at a little past dusk for the past three days.  We came up with this brilliant plan to get back at Benji.  I was supposed to make nice.  Pay him whatever I owed him - which was nothing.  He'd scammed me after all, but I still owed him money.  I had missed that part in the briefing.  

Abraham gave me the funds and I was to play nice with Benji.  So that made us getting together all that much easier; all part of the game.

Meanwhile Benji still hadn't told me what he overheard.  We were in the hotel bar, Benji had been going on about Nox and the missed messages, which had gotten a lot more frequent over the past few days.  Like he was bored or something.  I still hadn't read them.

And I could have sworn that sitting three seats down was **my** pretty boy.  But I had places to be - another meeting but not with Abraham this time - with some guy named Deacon.  Abraham wanted me to suss out who he was and if he was for real.  Apparently he stole something and Abraham wanted to know if it was real or not.  Or just some game he was playing.

When Abraham had figured out I was a telepath which was awkward he didn't freak out like he had with Benji.  He figured I was pissed cause I was beaten at my own game.  I let him think that.  Benji could never beat me though.

So I left with the distinct feeling of a pair of brown eyes on my back.  And all I heard was Benji laughing so I didn't know if I'd heard him or not.  I swear it was Nox who I'd seen.

Deacon and I were meeting at another bar in another casino.  I didn't want a vampire grunt anywhere near where I was staying so I was alright with that.  Turned out the man was pure human - a thief but still human.  He had an uncanny ability to sneak around wherever he wanted.  My gut said he had some sort of path ability that I was certain my pretty boy could tell me about.  Fucking invisibility or something.  This fucking world was mind blowing.

The man looked sleazy, with his hair slicked back and his leather jacket pulled up around his ears.  He looked like he was in some gangster movie.  I walked up to him and sat down across from him, "James Hutton.  And you are Deacon LeClaire?"

"I am.  Care for a drink?"

I shook my head.  "No.  Thank you.  I want to know what you have for sale.  And is it real, my employer sent me to check it out."  My employer sounded so wrong.   ead hin g for a e.

I offered him my hand and he took it with trust completely unknown to him that was just the key I needed to make that connection.  To see inside his head behind any natural shielding.  If only it worked with Nox...

Why was pretty boy in my head still.  Sure James was cocky and confident but Nox was a mess too.  I sighed inwardly.  I was never going to get over this if he didn't get the fuck out of my head.

Deacon shrugged as I sat down.  "It's just a book I stole from some club.  It was under lock and key in a safe so it has to be important right?  Don't know what the fuck it is, I can't read it.  It's written in some weird ass ink that looks like it moves.  I've only looked at it once."

"Can I see it?"  I asked.

"I don't have it with me."  Which I knew.  He wasn't lying about having it.  And Abraham hadn't actually told me what it was supposed to look like. I just wanted to see where he kept it.  Can't steal it otherwise.  That wasn't my job.  But this was the guy that Anthony Giovanni was after.  I'd seen him trailing the guy when I was doing my recon.  The vampire was hiding in plain sight as a tourist.  He'd been playing poker rather badly when I saw the vampire prince.  I don't know why he didn't send someone else to do his work.  He was a fucking prince like Abraham and that vampire didn't do anything himself.

Though I'd not see the other guy with him in a few
