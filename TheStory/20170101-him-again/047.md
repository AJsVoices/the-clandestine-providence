#  I could filter through surface thoughts undetected until I figured out something I didn't know what I was figuring out, but I knew it would come to me.

We were waiting on the dealer it seemed, no one was quick to change out my money
for chips. There was another man sitting next to the vampire prince, the only
thing I knew was he was a vampire, but he breathed. I knew that meant something
but I didn't know what. I nodded at him and offered my hand. "James Hutton." I
wanted to say, Hutton, James Hutton but I figured that was a little too corny
and I was being sauve and cool and I wasn't even sure that Nox knew who James
Bond was.
