# Dinner with Family
Marco had us sitting in a corner away from everyone else and there were no menus brought to us only a glass of water and whatever else the boys wanted to drink.  Kyle looked at Laker and frowned.  I interrupted, "We know the chef.  He'll make us something special.  Are you allergic to anything?"  I asked.

"Shell fish."

Rider laughed, "Us too."
