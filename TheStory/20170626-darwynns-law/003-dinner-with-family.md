# Dinner with Family
Marco had us sitting in a corner away from everyone else and there were no menus brought to us only a glass of water and whatever else the boys wanted to drink.  Kyle looked at Laker and frowned.  I interrupted, "We know the chef.  He'll make us something special.  Are you allergic to anything?"  I asked.

"Shell fish."

Rider laughed, "Us too.  Anything else?"

Kyle shook his head.  "No, don't think so.  You all are allergic to shell fish?"

"Mom was and we got it from her."  Laker said.

"I guess that makes it easy then."  

Rider shrugged, "We eat a lot of chicken while we are here in New York.  I think the only time we get pasta is when we come here."

"That has to get boring."
