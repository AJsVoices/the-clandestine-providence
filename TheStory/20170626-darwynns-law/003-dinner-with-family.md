# Dinner with Family
Marco had us sitting in a corner away from everyone else and there were no menus brought to us only a glass of water and whatever else the boys wanted to drink.  Kyle looked at Laker and frowned.  I interrupted, "We know the chef.  He'll make us something special.  Are you allergic to anything?"  I asked.

"Shell fish."

Rider laughed, "Us too.  Anything else?"

Kyle shook his head.  "No, don't think so.  You all are allergic to shell fish?"

"Mom was and we got it from her."  Laker said.

"I guess that makes it easy then."  

Rider shrugged, "We eat a lot of chicken while we are here in New York.  I think the only time we get pasta is when we come here."

"That has to get boring." Kyle said as the waitress came by and set down a basket of bread with garlic flavored oil with other herbs and an antipasto dish that I loved.  

She smiled at me, "The chef asks if there are any new allergies."

I shook my head, "Same as usual.  The boys want pasta though."

She giggled, "He said you'd say that.  And you?"

"He knows what I like."  

She nodded, "I'll tell him so, sir.  I hope you have a great meal."

Rider laughed, "I'm sure we will."

Dinner went as well as to be expected.  Laker and Rider went on and on about the Rockies.  And Kyle listened politely.  I got to listen to my brothers and their midwestern non-accented voices picking up the New York ticks.  I hadn't paid much mind to it before but there was a definite contrast to how Kyle and I spoke to my brothers and they were picking up the  same lit to their voices even being for only a week or so.

My phone chirped and I glanced at the message.  "It's Sage I'll be back in a minute."

Rider laughed, "Don't leave me with these two."

I gave him a wry smile and shrugged.  "Sorry."  I was dialing Sage's number as I headed outside to take the call.  It wasn't much quieter outside but at least I wouldn't be disrupting someone else's dinner.

"You got a location?"  I asked Sage when he picked up.

"I do."  He said.  "He wasn't hard to find.  But you aren't going to like it."

"Where is he?" I asked, "As long as he's not dead I think I can deal with it."

Sage sighed.  "He's in Vegas."

"What?"  I asked.

"His phone is in Vegas.  His secondary phone is in Vegas."
