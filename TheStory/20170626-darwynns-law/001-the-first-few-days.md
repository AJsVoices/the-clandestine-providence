# The First Few Days
Vacations were supposed to be for destressing.  Not for me.  Rider and Laker tried to get me to take them to the beach.  Mia happily took them for me.  I couldn't deal with the sand right now.  I was a mess.  A pile of fucking nerves because Alex's doorman, Joe hadn't seen Alex since the night I walked out on him.  I'd been by the apartment - both of them - everyday for since then and he hadn't seen him.  

Joe was nice enough to take my number said he'd text me if he saw Alex.  But I hadn't gotten anything from him either.  Alex neither.  I was getting concerned.  And that was making me dream of Alex and dreaming of Alex meant that I had more nightmares.  The blue eyed demon came before the red and I got a double dose of pain and bleeding and just plain agony.  It was Monday morning and I knew it was early - too early for Sage to be up but I didn't give a fuck at this point as I dialed his number by heart.

It rang four times then went to voice mail and I hung up and dialed again.  On the third ring Sage answered, "This better be important."

He sighed.  "No, I'll do it.  I'll call you when I have a location."

"Thank you."  But Sage was already gone.  I sighed and flopped back on my bed.  I should go downstairs to the gym.  Or maybe I should go to the beach with my brothers.  I could go take them to play paintball.  I could have Dorian bring Drake over.  No - I forgot he's with Reginald and the other dragons doing dragon things.  Whatever the fuck that was.

I pulled myself up off my bed and paced.  Ophelia meowed at me, "What?"

She threw her tail up and then curled up and ignored me.  "Yeah yeah yeah.  I know I'm a mess. You'd be a mess too."  I could see her tail twitch and then she put her head down on her paws and ignored me more.  Stupid cat.  Though I said it lovingly.  I reached down and rubbed her head and then left her alone.  She'd scratch me just the same.
