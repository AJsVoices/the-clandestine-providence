# The First Few Days
Vacations were supposed to be for destressing.  Not for me.  Rider and Laker tried to get me to take them to the beach.  Mia happily took them for me.  I couldn't deal with the sand right now.  I was a mess.  A pile of fucking nerves because Alex's doorman, Joe hadn't seen Alex since the night I walked out on him.  I'd been by the apartment - both of them - everyday for since then and he hadn't seen him.  

Joe was nice enough to take my number said he'd text me if he saw Alex.  But I hadn't gotten anything from him either.  Alex neither.  I was getting concerned.  And that was making me dream of Alex and dreaming of Alex meant that I had more nightmares.  The blue eyed demon came before the red and I got a double dose of pain and bleeding and just plain agony.  It was Monday morning and I knew it was early - too early for Sage to be up but I didn't give a fuck at this point as I dialed his number by heart.

It rang four times then went to voice mail and I hung up and dialed again.  On the third ring Sage answered, "This better be important."

"It is to me."  I said, there was a hitch in my voice and I heard Sage sit up.  "What's wrong, Nox?"

"I need you to track Alex's number."

Sage sighed, "Nox he's gone.  Why do you want me to do that?"

"Sage will you do it or not?  Or do I need to go let Trix do it?"  It was a threat I could use now.  My best friend wouldn't do it for me, then I'd just seek out one of the two other hackers I already knew.

He sighed.  "No, I'll do it.  I'll call you when I have a location."

"Thank you."  But Sage was already gone.  I sighed and flopped back on my bed.  I should go downstairs to the gym.  Or maybe I should go to the beach with my brothers.  I could go take them to play paintball.  I could have Dorian bring Drake over.  No - I forgot he's with Reginald and the other dragons doing dragon things.  Whatever the fuck that was.

I pulled myself up off my bed and paced.  Ophelia meowed at me, "What?"

She threw her tail up and then curled up and ignored me.  "Yeah yeah yeah.  I know I'm a mess. You'd be a mess too."  I could see her tail twitch and then she put her head down on her paws and ignored me more.  Stupid cat.  Though I said it lovingly.  I reached down and rubbed her head and then left her alone.  She'd scratch me just the same.

It was mid morning which  meant I'd been up for 6 hours already.  My brothers were playing video games and I sat I flopped down in their laps and then grunted but didn't say anything more as they raced around whatever track they were playing.  I glanced at the screen and saw no race cars, they were playing some shoot em up game.  Each on their own TV screen.  I wasn't sure where I got a second one, but there was no telling what Dorian and/or Kai bought my brothers.

Kai treated Laker and Rider like grandkids.  I don't know why, but he adored them almost as much as his other grand kids.  I was happy that he did, but I wondered why.  Maybe it was all the lost time.

"You want to go out to eat tonight?"  Laker asked.  "Marco said he'd save us all a table if we could convince you to come out with us?"  

"Can we do lunch?  I might be busy later tonight."

Rider chuckled, "Did Sage agree?"

"He did.  But not lightly."

"You'll owe him big."  Laker laughed.

"I'm okay with that.  I just need to find him.  I just hope he's not lying dead in a ditch somewhere."  I sighed.  

Rider patted my shoulder, "He's alright.  I'm sure he's just busy."

"I mean who wouldn't love to be with you.  You cook, you clean, I'm sure you are a good fuck."

I looked back at my brother, "Do you often wonder about how good I am in bed?"

Laker blushed, "No.  But you had Michaela and Alex and I'm sure you've had a lot others too."  

"You think a lot about my sex life."

Laker hung his head.  "No.  I just..."

"You just what?"

"How'd ya know?"

"How'd I know what?"

Rider chipped in, "That you liked boys.  Laker's got a friend..."  He grinned at his brother.

"Is he gay?"  I asked.

Laker shrugged.  "I don't know."

Rider giggled.  "He's into Laker, Lake isn't sure he wants to be into him or not."

I sat up and squished between my brothers and leaned against Laker.  "Look, man.  You don't have to decide now.  Take it slow, if you like him, ask him out.  Worst he can say is no, and if he lays a finger on you for asking I want to know."

Laker shook his head, "He'd never hurt me."

"Good."  I smiled at him.  "Bring him over for dinner one day.  I'll cook, we'll all have fun.  And you can see where it goes, in a safe environment.  And I have plenty of condoms if you need them."  The latter part of my words made my brother blush bright red.

"Dad would never entertain this idea."

"Do you think he'll be upset?"
