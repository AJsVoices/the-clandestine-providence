# Benji
When we were outside and several blocks away from the strip Benji opened a door to a building in the side of some diner.  It smelled like the kitchen was nearby cooking some kind of Asian food.  "Korean."  He said without me having to ask.

"You know that's as weird as when _he_ does that."  I said.

Benji shook his head.  "Sorry.  I forget that you weren't asking out loud."

I shrugged, "I'm used to it."

"And you've never slept with him?" I asked.

Benji smirked, "He'd probably have liked that if I liked boys."
