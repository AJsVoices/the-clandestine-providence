# Venatori Problems
I was out the door before I regretted doing that.  I stopped and was about to turn around when a pair of crossed swords blocked my view.  I smirked and sighed, "I'll be up there in a bit. I haven't been here long."

The man on the right was large.  He could probably break me in half without blinking an eye.  "You need to come with us, Mr. Sétanta, Ms. Snow is looking forward to meeting the infamous Mr. Sétanta."

I sighed.  "Fine."  I didn't fight them, there was no point.  I was on their territory without permission.  I thought Dorian had cleared the path but I guess I was wrong.  I followed tweedle-dee and tweedle-dumb through the streets of Vegas.  At least they had wait until I was alone to abduct me.  That was nice of them.
