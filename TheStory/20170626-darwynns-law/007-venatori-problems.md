# Venatori Problems
I was out the door before I regretted doing that.  I stopped and was about to turn around when a pair of crossed swords blocked my view.  I smirked and sighed, "I'll be up there in a bit. I haven't been here long."

The man on the right was large.  He could probably break me in half without blinking an eye.  "You need to come with us, Mr. Sétanta, Ms. Snow is looking forward to meeting the infamous Mr. Sétanta."

I sighed.  "Fine."  I didn't fight them, there was no point.  I was on their territory without permission.  I thought Dorian had cleared the path but I guess I was wrong.  I followed tweedle-dee and tweedle-dumb through the streets of Vegas.  At least they had wait until I was alone to abduct me.  That was nice of them.  I had heard of Scarlet Snow, she ran Vegas like Dae'lin and Gary did New York City.  There were many locations like that around the world.  Technically Michaela fell under Scarlet's regime, even though the HQ was officially in Boulder where Michaela was stationed, but Scarlet Snow was too big too powerful to stay in the middle of east bumblefuck and rule the Venatori with her iron fist.

I had never expected to meet her though.  I guess I was gonna get that wish regardless of whether or not I wanted it.  She was a scary sob if the rumors were true.  We walked into one of the fancy casinos and headed off to the side to the executive elevators.  The high rollers and such and we went all the way to the top floor.  Ms. Snow was rich and famous and she paraded the exotic on stage of her hotel and casino.  She didn't have real magic or dragons in use that would be a gross breach of The Clandestine Providence but she skirted the edge of reality with her shows.  There was a lot of things that could go wrong here.
