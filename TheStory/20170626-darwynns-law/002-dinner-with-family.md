# Dinner with Family
Laker called his friend and until the boys decided one way or the other that's how he'd remain in my eyes.  I found it comforting and a little scary that my little  brother was seeing boys as potential love interests, while the other was firmly into girls.  Was I a bad influence?

Kyle met us down stairs as we left to go into Little Italy.  He was about as tall as my brother but he was thinner and wore glasses.  His red hair and freckles made me think of Ron Howard back in the day.  Laker was wearing a leather jacket and I couldn't help but laugh at the image in my head.  The Fonz and Richie, how fucking epic.  I snapped a picture and I'd show Sage later.  

I introduced myself, "I'm Nox," I offered him my hand.  

He flipped my hand to examine the black nail polish. "Why don't you match them?" Kyle nodded to my head.

"I don't have the color nail polish so it's easier just to stick with black."

"My mom won't let me do any of that."  He said.

I asked, "Why?"

"She doesn't want me to look like a girl."  Kyle groaned out.

"I look like a girl?"  I grinned at him.

"No.  But she doesn't think about it like that."  

"She's just looking out for you.  I got a beat down or two as a kid growing up.  Kissed a boy and he kicked the shit out of me.  I got a few for wearing eye liner and nail polish.
