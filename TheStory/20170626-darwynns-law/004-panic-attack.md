# Panic Attack
I didn't have time to stop by the apartment and grab anything.  Sage sent me a text.

S: Good luck, babe.  I hope you rip him a new one.

I really didn't know why they kept thinking I was going to be mad at him.  I just wanted to know for real.  What this was.  I thought he wanted more.  I'd been torturing myself looking for missing dreams and he left.  Why was I even going.  And flying?  What the fuck.

But even my dreary thoughts didn't turn me from hailing a cab.  It didn't stop me from standing in line at the front desk checking my non-existent bags.  I walked through security and to my terminal.  It didn't stop me from sitting down and closing my eyes to rest while I waited.  The last flight I took I met Henry, and I dreamt of Alex before I knew his name.  I don't know how I remembered that but I do now.  Like sitting here reminded me of that dream.

I could feel my heart racing and my skin getting slick with sweat.  Thankfully I didn't have to wait long before my seats were called.  I hated the back of the plane but you take what you can get on short notice.  Boarding was easy and unfortunately I had a window seat.  Fuck!  Just what I needed.

I pulled the window shade down, buckled up and pressed my back into the back of the chair gripped the arms and closed my eyes.  I was so in the middle of a panic attack.  I was grateful that I had a pair of earbuds on me at all times at least when the plane got in the air I could listen to my music.  Or music of some sort.  

I should nap, but I knew that wasn't going to happen.  My heart felt like it was pounding out of my chest as the gray haired woman and a young child sat down next to me.  The kid couldn't be more than three and I was going to go crazy if the kid whined the whole time.  Fuck!

The woman looked at me, "You okay honey?"

I nodded, "I don't like flying."

She patted my hand.  "It's safer than driving."

I laughed.  "I don't like driving."

She paled a little at my sarcasm.  I knew logically I'd be fine.  But my childhood trauma had only made this worse.  My fear of heights was only enhanced by sitting by the window.  My heart pounded in my chest.  It took forever for the plane to load and the airline attendants to do their thing as we taxied down the strip to get ready for our flight.

The child next to me yammered on.  I was grateful his grandmother was sitting between us but I couldn't wait for my music to be the only sound I heard.  Fuck!

We started moving faster and tilting up and I squished my eyes clothes as I tried to keep my breathing even.  The kid next to me screamed as his ears built up pressure and he didn't know how to react.  My body tensed and I had a death grip on the arm rests.  The woman next to me didn't know what to do, between me and the screaming child.

The child eventually stopped as his ears equalized and I relaxed when the ding that signaled we could use our electronics was sounded.  I quickly pulled my earbuds out of my pocket and plugged it in and set the music to as loud as it would go.  I didn't care what I listened to as long as I could drown in it and feel nothing else.  

I listened to something loud and heavy.  It was not a usual playlist - more like one I played when I needed to focus on something other than my life.  Or the moment.  It was the music I listened to.  Sage would have been proud.
