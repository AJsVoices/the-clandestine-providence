# Panic Attack
I didn't have time to stop by the apartment and grab anything.  Sage sent me a text.

S: Good luck, babe.  I hope you rip him a new one.

I really didn't know why they kept thinking I was going to be mad at him.  I just wanted to know for real.  What this was.  I thought he wanted more.  I'd been torturing myself looking for missing dreams and he left.  Why was I even going.  And flying?  What the fuck.

But even my dreary thoughts didn't turn me from hailing a cab.  It didn't stop me from standing in line at the front desk checking my non-existent bags.  I walked through security and to my terminal.  It didn't stop me from sitting down and closing my eyes to rest while I waited.  The last flight I took I met Henry, and I dreamt of Alex before I knew his name.  I don't know how I remembered that but I do now.  Like sitting here reminded me of that dream.
