# Panic Attack
I didn't have time to stop by the apartment and grab anything.  Sage sent me a text.

S: Good luck, babe.  I hope you rip him a new one.

I really didn't know why they kept thinking I was going to be mad at him.  I just wanted to know for real.  What this was.  I thought he wanted more.  I'd been torturing myself looking for missing dreams and he left.  Why was I even going.  And flying?  What the fuck.

But even my dreary thoughts didn't turn me from hailing a cab.  It didn't stop me from standing in line at the front desk checking my non-existent bags.  I walked through security and to my terminal.  It didn't stop me from sitting down and closing my eyes to rest while I waited.  The last flight I took I met Henry, and I dreamt of Alex before I knew his name.  I don't know how I remembered that but I do now.  Like sitting here reminded me of that dream.

I could feel my heart racing and my skin getting slick with sweat.  Thankfully I didn't have to wait long before my seats were called.  I hated the back of the plane but you take what you can get on short notice.  Boarding was easy and unfortunately I had a window seat.  Fuck!  Just what I needed.

I pulled the window shade down, buckled up and pressed my back into the back of the chair gripped the arms and closed my eyes.  I was so in the middle of a panic attack.  I was grateful that I had a pair of earbuds on me at all times at least when the plane got in the air I could listen to my music.  Or music of some sort.  

I should nap, but I knew that wasn't going to happen.  My heart felt like it was pounding out of my chest as the gray haired woman and a young child sat down next to me.  The kid couldn't be more than three and I was going to go crazy if the kid whined the whole time.  Fuck!

The woman looked at me, "You okay honey?"

I nodded, "I don't like flying."

She patted my hand.  "It's safer than driving."

I laughed.  "I don't like driving."

She paled a little at my sarcasm.  I knew logic
