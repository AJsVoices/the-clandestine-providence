# Arrival
My thoughts drifted to Alex the whole flight.  I was hard and wonton by the time we landed and the woman next to me hurried off the plane as quickly as she could.  As much as I wanted off the plane, I decided to wait until everyone cleared out.  It was better for me.  Even though the plane was getting chlosterphobic and I was having a hard time breathing.

One of the male attendants was making sure no one left anything on the plane or sleeping still in their seats when I stood up to get out of the plane.  He looked down at me and chuckled, "I was wondering why she glared at you so."

"Dreams."  I smirked, "What can I say they were sexy."

"I hope he's worth it."  He said with a smile, "If not I'll be in town until the morning."

I looked at his nameplate, "Alejandro."  I smiled, "Thanks, but I think if he throws me out I'll be leaving tonight."

Alejandro laughed, "Offer still stands."  He gave me the once over and I gave him a parting smile as I headed out the door.  I could feel the other man's eyes on my back and knew I could hear him whispering to the other flight attendant, "My he's yummy."

They giggled and I pretended I hadn't heard them as I headed out of the terminal.  The heat was dry and I felt warm in my hoodie, but I didn't take it off even after I'd stepped outside into the evening sun.  It was a five hour flight, but my phone told me it was only three hours later.  Time zones...  I sighed as I  texted Sage.

N: I've landed.  Hotel and room?

Sage texted me back immediately with the Bellagio hotel and a room number.  He also texted me a name it was under - James Hutton.

I wondered how many alias' Alex had.  And I wondered what sort of business he actually did.  Not that it mattered really, but aliases implied illegal activity.  Last thing Alex needed was me meddling in some plot of his.  I didn't believe Janice was a friend.  And I didn't think Alex floated in her circles, but I could be wrong.  So totally and utterly wrong, but I knew Alex.  Even when I didn't know know him, I knew him.  I'd been in love with a dream since I was 13.  He was the one who gave me the courage to kiss Dylan.  He was the one, he'd always been that.  But he'd been a dream.  And one I didn't remember.

A cab to the hotel was easy to come by.  I felt out of place in this City, though I looked no different than any of the others, but it was still that strange feeling like I didn't belong.

I could wait in the lobby for Alex.  I could ask at the front desk.  I could go up and wait outside his room.  But instead I went into the bar.  It was busy for the time of day.  But this was Vegas and there were a lot of vacationers her
