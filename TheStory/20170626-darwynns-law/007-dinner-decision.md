# Dinner Decision
I walked around the strip for a few hours.  I went inside Circus Circus and watched things going on.  I sat in front of the Bellagio waiting until time before I headed back down the strip bored again.  There was only so much of the water falling I could do without tears falling.  

I was a fucking mess and I needed to go but I kept trying to make up my mind.  I'd sit and thing and I'd be ready to leave.  I wanted to go home, leave Alex to his life like he wanted.  And then I'd close my eyes and I would drift into the dreams and then I'd see him again in my dreams and I'd need to see his blue eyes again for real.

I was washing back and forth and even the walk through city wasn't helping.  It was nearly six and I made my way back to the Bellagio where Alex was staying as James Hutton.  Jimmy, Benji kept calling him.  I didn't want to interrupt Alex's dinner with his friend so I didn't go right up.  I stopped in the gift shop and saw some flowers.  I bought some flowers, they were a mix of wild flowers.  Nothing fancy but I thought they were nice enough anyway.  I'd never bought flowers for anyone before.  

But it was food and Dorian would be upset if I didn't bring wine, so I asked in the bar.  The guy at the bar looked at me and frowned, "What can I do for you?"

"I'd like your best red wine in a bottle."

"You can't afford it."

I sighed and took out my wallet and dropped a couple hundred on the bar.  "Can I now?"

He shook his head.  "Sorry man."  He didn't wait for me to say anything more as he headed to the back to grab a bottle for me.  

When he returned he took both bills and smiled.  "Thanks. for your patronage."

I nodded.  "You're welcome."

I didn't wait for change, I knew I wasn't getting any change back.  I took the stairs one at a time all the way up to Alex's room.  I walked down the hall and past his room.  And then I turned back and walked past his room again.  I tried to listen in his room to see if he and Benji were there or if they had gone out.  I managed to hear a word or two but the couple across the hall were going at it like rabbits.  And there was a baby crying down a few floors.  So I didn't keep my senses out long, just long enough to know they were in there.  

I paced for an hour.  Thankfully the wine had been warm so I wasn't ruining it yet.  The flowers weren't wilting yet, but I was making myself nervous.  I stopped in front of the door and I thought about knocking.  I stared at the door for several more minutes before I paced again.  

I stopped and worried if I was doing the right thing.  I even made it to the elevator a few times before I turned back.  

Close to the second hour outside of debating I sat down across from the hall and leaned my head against the wall.  I closed my eyes and I saw Alex in my head.
