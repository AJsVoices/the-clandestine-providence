# Dinner Decision
I walked around the strip for a few hours.  I went inside Circus Circus and watched things going on.  I sat in front of the Bellagio waiting until time before I headed back down the strip bored again.  There was only so much of the water falling I could do without tears falling.  

I was a fucking mess and I needed to go but I kept trying to make up my mind.  I'd sit and thing and I'd be ready to leave.  I wanted to go home, leave Alex to his life like he wanted.  And then I'd close my eyes and I would drift into the dreams and then I'd see him again in my dreams and I'd need to see his blue eyes again for real.

I was washing back and forth and even the walk through city wasn't helping.  It was nearly six and I made my way back to the Bellagio where Alex was staying as James Hutton.  Jimmy, Benji kept calling him.  I didn't want to interrupt Alex's dinner with his friend so I didn't go right up.  I stopped in the gift shop and saw some flowers.  I bought some flowers, they were a mix of wild flowers.  Nothing fancy but I thought they were nice enough anyway.  I'd never bought flowers for anyone before.  

But it was food and Dorian would be upset if I didn't bring wine, so I asked in the bar.  The guy at the bar looked at me and frowned, "What can I do for you?"

"I'd like your best red wine in a bottle."

"You can't afford it."

I sighed and took out my wallet and dropped a couple hundred on the bar.  "Can I now?"

He shook his head.  "Sorry man."  He didn't wait for me to say anything more as he headed to the back to grab a bottle for me.  

When he returned he took both bills and smiled.  "Thanks. for your patronage."

I nodded.  "You're welcome."

I didn't wait for change, I knew I wasn't getting any change back.  I took the stairs one at a time all the way up to Alex's room.  I walked down the hall and past his room.  And then I turned back and walked past his room again.  I tried to listen in his room to see if he and Benji were there or if they had gone out.  I managed to hear a word or two but the couple across the hall were going at it like rabbits.  And there was a baby crying down a few floors.  So I didn't keep my senses out long, just long enough to know they were in there.  

I paced for an hour.  Thankfully the wine had been warm so I wasn't ruining it yet.  The flowers weren't wilting yet, but I was making myself nervous.  I stopped in front of the door and I thought about knocking.  I stared at the door for several more minutes before I paced again.  

I stopped and worried if I was doing the right thing.  I even made it to the elevator a few times before I turned back.  

Close to the second hour outside of debating I sat down across from the hall and leaned my head against the wall.  I closed my eyes and I saw Alex in my head.  It was a recent dream.  I couldn't see anything, just dark.  Me and Alex.  Just the two of us.

I was lost in my thoughts when I heard the door open.  I stood up before the door opened and Benji, with his asian complexion and his frosted hair looked at me and asked, "How long have you been out here?"

I didn't say anything as I saw Alex lumbering this way curious.  My breath caught as I saw him in a pair of sweats and a t-shirt.  His hair was blonde.  I knew I'd seen that before, but seeing it with his blue eyes I couldn't really make heads or tails of it.  I wanted to say something but I just stared at him.  

Benji laughed breaking the silence.  "I was just leaving."  He said as he slipped between me and the wall and headed for the elevator.  

The elevator dinged and I heard them slide closed and Alex and I hadn't said a thing or moved, we only stared at each other.  I broke our gaze and looked down at the floor pushing the flowers and wine at Alex as I did so.  I stared at his chest, not the floor.  He didn't like when I went submissive but the silence and the staring made me uncomfortable.

Alex asked, "What are you doing here?"  It wasn't a pleasant tone and I wanted to shriek away from it.  He was angry.

I started to stay something but my voice caught.  I took a deep breath and tried again.  "I was worried about you."  I lifted my eyes to meet his.  "You weren't answering my texts and you never even told me you were leaving."  As I spoke my voice turned to a growl.  My anger shown through.  "You didn't even have the decency to break up with me.  Just fucking left."

Alex hadn't taken the offerings and I was in a wrong moment.  I squatted down and laid the offerings at his feet and I looked up remember that view.  It was the last time I was going to see it.  I stood up and I took a step back.  "I came here to see you are alright.  You seem to be doing great, forgetting me with ease.  So I'm going to do the decent thing."  I squared my shoulders and I looked Alex straight in his blue eyes and I said, "I spent the last few days remembering everything you made me forget about us.  And now, I wish I hadn't found out.  You can go to hell, Al..."  His name was muffled by his lips as he pressed a hard and fast kiss against my lips.  He grabbed a fistful of my shirt and pulled me past the threshold of his room.  I kicked the flowers and wine bottle inside and Alex kicked the door shut.

Once inside I sho
