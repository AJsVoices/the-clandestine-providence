# Dinner Decision
I walked around the strip for a few hours.  I went inside Circus Circus and watched things going on.  I sat in front of the Bellagio waiting until time before I headed back down the strip bored again.  There was only so much of the water falling I could do without tears falling.  

I was a fucking mess and I needed to go but I kept trying to make up my mind.  I'd sit and thing and I'd be ready to leave.  I wanted to go home, leave Alex to his life like he wanted.  And then I'd close my eyes and I would drift into the dreams and then I'd see him again in my dreams and I'd need to see his blue eyes again for real.

I was washing back and forth and even the walk through city wasn't helping.  It was nearly six and I made my way back to the Bellagio where Alex was staying as James Hutton.  Jimmy, Benji kept calling him.  I didn't want to interrupt Alex's dinner with his friend so I didn't go right up.  I stopped in the gift shop and saw some flowers.  I bought some flowers, they were a mix of wild flowers.  Nothing fancy but I thought they were nice enough anyway.  I'd never bought flowers for anyone before
