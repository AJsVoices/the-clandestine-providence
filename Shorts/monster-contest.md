### Draft # 1
The walls were white covered in shelves and the floors were made of wood.  A pile of blocks were unceremoniously strewn across the floor and their bins tipped over at the edge.  I was wearing a green felt monster costume and big red floppy shoes.  The mask fell over my face and I had to keep pushing it up.  It was always the same, but what I choose to do with the blocks was my choice. 

I grabbed a handful of lettered blocks.   Carefully I laid the block with an 'M' on the ground.  Stacked the o, and then the n.  I could stop there, but my mind wouldn't let me.  I added the s and then the t followed by the e and r.  No matter which block I used it always spelled monster.  Just like the voices always echoed monster through the curtains blowing in the wind.

Now came the fun part.  I growled as I stood up and stomped on the first tower.  I growled louder as I crushed two more.  I was lifting my foot when a new voice spoke softly from behind me.  "Aren't we getting a little too old to be playing with blocks?" 

I turned to see a pair of striking ice blue eyes behind me and a smirk on his lips.  His hair was a tossled mess, and I recognized him from a TV show I'd seen my roommates watching.  I grinned at him and he came over to me and tugged the monster mask off.  "Aren't you like fifteen now?"

That was the key, he knew me, even though I didn't know him.  He made me happy.  My Mushu, made me happy.  It was the only name I ever knew him by.  We kept it that way since as long as I could remember.

The air no longer whispered the singular word as I hugged my good friend, Alex,  good-bye.  His ice blue eyes sparkled as we waved and the world shimmered and I rubbed my eyes to clear the dream from them.  It was morning - time to get to school.  My roommates were still asleep as I hurried through my routine.  I wasn't going to be late, but I hurried none-the-less.  Being late meant extra time, and extra time made me cry.

I was early to class behind the orange door - Mr. Garrett's class.  I was his only student.  He wasn't even there yet as I pushed the orange door open.  The door creaked only a little and I knew where to stop it before the sound alerted anyone to my presence.  Not that anyone was here.

I set my belongings in the corner where I always did.  I didn't take a seat, I was never allowed to sit in the room behind the orange door.  I took up my position by the wall across from the orange door, under the large window that overlooked the room.  I stood with my feet directly under my hips, a foot away from the wall.  I pressed my long fingers into the wall in front of me and I leaned forward just a little.  I took a deep breath and I closed my eyes while I waited for Mr. Garrett to join me.  I drifted back to sleep without meaning to, I hadn't thought I was that tired, but Alex and I must have played really hard the night before.  The memories were fading but those blue eyes and his little voice always stayed with me.  

The room was the same as it always was.  The white walls, and the wooden floor.  The blocks still scattered on the floor from last nights play session.  I picked up the little blocks we'd stacked earlier and put them in their colored bins as the letters flicked from m to o as I dropped in the first two blocks, the third was always s, and so on until all blocks spelled monster - each and every time.  Even the wind in the curtains whispered monster.

A familiar voice sounded behind me, "Hey, Nox, I thought you had to get up for class?"

"I did.  I think I fell asleep waiting."  I said softly, as if I were actually in class.  "You should go before..."

I heard the orange door clang shut and I felt a hand on my shoulder and I winced underneath the pressure.  The wicked voice laughed at me as he sat down.  He never said anything and then, just as Alex had appeared so did he.  He never looked like he did in the real world.  It was always a shadow with glowing red eyes.  It grew bigger and bigger the closer it came.  

The glowing red eyes looked from me, to Alex.  I screamed, "No!"  And the shadow smirked with a toothy grin as it wound Alex up.  My friend couldn't scream, his mouth was covered.  

It was a fast reaction, the fastest I'd ever done it.  The fastest I had ever formed fire willingly since my first days here.  I was afraid of the fire, always afraid, but Alex... He was my friend, and Mr. Garrett couldn't hurt him.  I wove with quickness and clarity, a ball of fire so large that when it hit the pair it blinded the room and I feel out of the dream.

I fell to my knees as Mr. Garrett sat still in his chair beside me.  I begged.  "No.  Please don't hurt Alex.  I'll do anything - everything."  I begged and pleaded over and over again, but Mr. Garrett wasn't listening to me.  I tried to get back into the dream but I couldn't.  My heart was racing, my blood pumping through my veins so hard it was all I could hear.

Mr. Garrett patted my shoulder, "That was well done, Nox.  You can go today.  That was excellent control."

I blinked at my teacher.  He never let me go early but I wasn't about to stall with permission to leave.  So I left as quickly as I'd come.  I scurried across the floor on my knees and grabbed my things and then rushed out the door and down the hall back to my room.

I flopped on my bed and I tried to dream.  Tried to fall asleep but the silence of the room did not come.  And I had to go about my day.  I wanted the day to end so badly but it dragged on and on until it was time for lights out and I eagerly pulled my blankets over my head and blocked out all the sounds of my roommates snoring.  I needed to see him.  But I was awake for hours trying to sleep.

When I drifted into the darkness finally I was releived to see the room.  But I didn't remember why I was releived to see the room. There were blocks stacked neatly in bins and I pulled them out as the whispers started, "monster."  The first time I heard it I looked around for the voice, "Who's there?"

But no one answered.  I saw no one.  The single word drifted on the air even as I tried to ignore it.  I stacked the blocks and even they spelled out that one word.  Nothing else but monster.  Everywhere was monster.

And then a voice from no where echoed in the room.  "Who are you?"  I turned to look and I saw the largest
