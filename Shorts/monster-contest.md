### Draft # 1
It always started the same.  The walls were white covered in shelves and the floors were made of wood.  A pile of blocks were unceremoniously strewen across the floor and their bins tipped over at the edge.  I was wearing a green felt monster costume and big red floppy shoes.  The mask fell over my face and I had to keep pushing it up.
