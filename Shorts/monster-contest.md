### Draft # 1
The walls were white covered in shelves and the floors were made of wood.  A pile of blocks were unceremoniously strewn across the floor and their bins tipped over at the edge.  I was wearing a green felt monster costume and big red floppy shoes.  The mask fell over my face and I had to keep pushing it up.  It was always the same, but what I choose to do with the blocks was my choice. 

I grabbed a handful of lettered blocks.   Carefully I laid the block with an 'M' on the ground.  Stacked the o, and then the n.  I could stop there, but my mind wouldn't let me.  I added the s and then the t followed by the e and r.  No matter which block I used it always spelled monster.  Just like the voices always echoed monster through the curtains blowing in the wind.

Now came the fun part.  I growled as I stood up and stomped on the first tower.  I growled louder as I crushed two more.  I was lifting my foot when a new voice spoke softly from behind me.  "Aren't we getting a little too old to be playing with blocks?" 

I turned to see a pair of striking ice blue eyes behind me and a smirk on his lips
