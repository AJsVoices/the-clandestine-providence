The room was always the same with it's white walls and wooden floor.  The only real color was the painting on the wall of a tree in a foreign landscape and the blocks piled high in their colorful bins.  Alex and I had played all night long.  Building towers and taking turns stomping on them like we were Godzilla.  Alex even made the sounds like in the old movies.  He made me laugh, but it was time to go and the air no longer whispered the singular word, my demons had no hold when Alex was with me. His eyes blue eyes sparkled as we gave each other a hug good bye and waved.

I stretched then  rubbed my eyes to clear the dream from my mind.  It was morning - time to get to class.  My roommates were still asleep as I hurried through my routine.  I wasn't going to be late, but I hurried none-the-less.  Being late meant extra time, and extra time was always a bad.

I was always early for class behind the orange door - Mr. Garrett's class.  I was his only student.  He wasn't even there yet as I pushed the orange door open.  The door creaked only a little and I knew where to stop it before the sound alerted anyone to my presence.  Not that anyone was here.

I set my belongings in the corner where I always did.  I didn't take a seat, I was never allowed to sit in the room behind the orange door.  I took up my position by the wall across from the orange door, under the large window that overlooked the room.  I stood with my feet directly under my hips, a foot away from the wall.  I pressed my long fingers into the wall in front of me and I leaned forward just a little.  I took a deep breath and I closed my eyes while I waited for Mr. Garrett to join me.  I drifted back to sleep without meaning to, I hadn't thought I was that tired, but Alex and I must have played really hard the night before.  The memories were fading but those blue eyes and his little voice always stayed with me.  

The room was the same as it always was.  The white walls, and the wooden floor.  The blocks still scattered on the floor from last nights play session.  I picked up the little blocks we'd stacked earlier and put them in their colored bins as the letters flicked from m to o as I dropped in the first two blocks, the third was always s, and so on until all blocks spelled monster - each and every time.  Even the wind in the curtains whispered monster.

A familiar voice sounded behind me, "Hey, Nox, I thought you had to get up for class?"

"I did.  I think I fell asleep waiting."  I said softly, as if I were actually in class.  "You should go before..."

I heard the orange door clang shut and I felt a hand on my shoulder and I winced underneath the pressure.  The wicked voice laughed at me as he sat down.  He never said anything and then, just as Alex had appeared so did he.  He never looked like he did in the real world.  It was always a shadow with glowing red eyes.  It grew bigger and bigger the closer it came.  

The glowing red eyes looked from me to Alex.  I screamed, "No!"  And the shadow smirked with a toothy grin as it wound Alex up with shadowy arms.  My friend couldn't scream, his mouth was covered.  

It was a fast reaction, the fastest I'd ever done it.  The fastest I had ever formed fire willingly since my first days here.  I was afraid of the fire, always afraid, but Alex... He was my friend, and Mr. Garrett couldn't hurt him.  I wove with quickness and clarity, a ball of fire so large that when it hit the pair it blinded the room and I feel out of the dream.

I fell to my knees as Mr. Garrett sat still in his chair beside me.  I begged.  "No.  Please don't hurt Alex.  I'll do anything - everything."  I begged and pleaded over and over again, but Mr. Garrett wasn't listening to me.  Though a soft wind blew my longer than usual hair even though there was no windows.  It felt like someone had run their fingers through my hair.  It was the only response to my pleading as  I tried to get back into the dream but I couldn't.  My heart was racing, my blood pumping through my veins so hard it was all I could hear.

And then without any warning, Mr. Garrett patted my shoulder, "That was well done, Nox.  You can go today.  That was excellent control."

I blinked at my teacher.  He never let me go early but I wasn't about to stall with permission to leave.  So I left as quickly as I'd come.  I scurried across the floor on my knees and grabbed my things and then rushed out the door and down the hall back to my room.

I flopped on my bed and I tried to dream.  Tried to fall asleep but the silence of the room did not come.  And I had to go about my day.  I wanted the day to end so badly but it dragged on and on until it was time for lights out and I eagerly pulled my blankets over my head and blocked out all the sounds of my roommates snoring.  I needed to see him.  But I was awake for hours trying to sleep.

When I finally drifted into the darkness I was relieved to see the room - the same as it always was with it's white walls and wooden floor.  But I didn't remember why I was releived to see the room. There were blocks stacked neatly in bins and I pulled them out as the whispers started, "monster."  The first time I heard it I looked around for the voice, "Who's there?"

But no one answered.  I saw no one.  The single word drifted on the air even as I tried to ignore it.  I stacked the blocks and even they spelled out that one word.  Nothing else but monster.  Everywhere was monster.

And then a voice from no where echoed in the room.  "Who are you?"  I turned to look and I saw the largest pair of ice blue eyes smiling back at me.  I shook my head, "Who are you?"

He shrugged.  "Can I play with you?"

"Sure."  I handed him a block and we started building towers that all spelled out the word monster over and over again.
