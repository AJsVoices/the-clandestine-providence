I sat in a cozy little chair surrounded by the smell of coffee and baked goods.  I mastered the theory behind memory regression related to my dreams with the help of Margo, my therapist, over the past few days.  I could think of a time in my life and find whatever dream I wanted.  I'd never remembered them before now but everything I'd forgotten was coming back and with each new memory the harder it became for me to stay away from Alex.  If I could even find him, he seemed to disappear off the planet.
