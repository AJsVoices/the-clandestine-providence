# Why I Can't Remember You
There is  one question I ask myself each time I think about us, "Why can't I remember you?" When I first met you out here in the real world I thought you were a dream come true, only to find out that was the absolute truth.  You are my love, my light and you say we've been dreaming about each other since we were little.
 
So I lay across my bed thinking about you again. Delving behind the locked door that stored my childhood dreams and memories, looking for the answer to the one question that plagues my mind.

I watch the sequences play like a movie in my head... 

The scene was so familiar I wanted to jump to the next memory but you drew me here, so here I'll stay - for you.

The darkness grew thicker as I watched from my vantage point.  I was afraid of the dark as a child.  I still sleep with a small light on in the bathroom even now.  Did you know that?  The fog rolled in with my demon - my own personal monster.  It whispered what I was thinking, 'monster'.  

No matter how many times I told myself I wasn't a monster, the words my mother said the day I sparked still echoed in my head.  I was a monster.  I thought I was past this, but obviously not.  My dreams echoed my self worth.

I knew what was next and I wanted to turn away to leave this awful dream - the one I have every night for as long as I could remember. But I stayed because you drew me here.

I was only watching as the first blow from the tentacle landed across my dream self's back.  "Spark."  My demon yelled.  I bit back the yelp that I felt across my scarred back.  It wasn't real but I felt it none the less.  Even now when it wasn't me receiving the beating I felt it split the skin along my back.

I hated this.  I wanted to leave but I was frozen in place.  I couldn't take it as I watched another blow land. And then another.  But before I could close my eyes I saw a figure in the darkness.  

A familiar voice echoed through and I didn't need to see his face to know it was you.  "Hey..." You started to say and then your face grew dark when you saw what was happening.  You flung the shadow from my dream.  The demon was gone, the world brightened.  The shadows lifted.  There was only you and me.  

I stood staring at you, relief on my face in both forms, but the younger me, he yelled.  "What are you doing here?"

"I felt you call."  You said.

"You can't be here.  If they find you, if he comes back.  If you are here he'll kill you.  They'll kill you."  I pleaded with you.  But you didn't understand.

You looked at me confused.  I didn't blame you.  This had to be the first time you found out what I was.  "You can't be here."  I pleaded again.  

"Talk to me Nox."  You put your hands on my shoulders and I winched in pain but I didn't shrink from your touch.  I knew that touch, that love.  I knew you would never hurt me.

"You're a dream walker.  We kill them.  Alex, on sight.  You can't be here.  If he comes back, he'll find you, and he'll kill you.  You can't come back here, not ever again."

"Nox..."  Your ice blue eyes were sad.  "I don't want to leave you.  What if they don't remember me?  Or you?  I can make them forget.  I can find him, make it even more a dream.  I've done it before."  You said.  

And as I watched I understood.  I understood why you aren't pissed at me for not remembering you, at least not as much as I would expect.  You know deep down why I can't.

"I'll make you forget me.  I'll visit, but you won't remember me.  We'll never use our names again, we'll wear different faces.  We'll be someone else - always some one else.  But I have to come here.  You are my only friend."  You pleaded with me.

"I don't want to forget you."  I was on the verge of tears - then and now.

"We have to,  Nox.  I can't know you are Venatori.  You can't try to remember me.  But I can't lose you."

I gave you a simple nod and you laid your hands on my neck and you pulled me close and you kissed me.  "I love you, Nox."  You whispered as the dream faded.  I didn't get to respond before I was ripped away from you.  The darkness surrounded me.  And my nightmare started all over again. 

There was no point in trying to escape the dream.  There never was.  Every cry for help.  Every tear I shed only made it worse.  Over and over again the nightmares came.  I remembered them, every blow, every tear.  But I didn't remember you.  The nightmare came ripping me away from you dream after dream after dream and you were safe.  That's all that mattered in the end.

My heart was racing as I lay on my bed thinking about us.  Thinking about what we did and why.  What happens now.  I know you are real.  I know your name.  Can I protect us both from my people - from the Venatori.
