I sat in a cozy little chair surrounded by the smell of coffee and baked goods.  I mastered the theory behind memory regression related to my dreams with the help of Margo, my therapist, over the past few days.  I could think of a time in my life and find whatever dream I wanted.  I'd never remembered them before now but everything I'd forgotten was coming back and with each new memory the harder it became for me to stay away from Alex.  If I could even find him, he seemed to disappear off the planet. But what I wanted to know was why I forgot and Alex didn't, there had to be one.

So I sat in this cozy little chair surrounded by smells that I loved and closed my eyes.  I could do that in my new apartment, but my brothers were annoying little shits at times and kept asking me what I was doing.  At least here no one would bother me as I sank into a dreamless state.  I'd once used drugs to get this type of serenity, but now, just a memory of Alex was all I needed.

I went all the way back to my childhood, to the first time I'd met Alex.  He was a cute kid even then with his ice blue eyes and his dark scraggly hair all over the place.  The dreams always started the same.  Me in a room with white walls and a wooden floor.  The only color in the room was the blocks stacked neatly in bins and the painting of a tree in a foreign landscape on the wall. 

The picture was always a little different, constantly changing.  I'd draw it over and over again inside my sketch book.
