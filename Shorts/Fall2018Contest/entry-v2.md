# Why I Can't Remember You
There is  one question I ask myself each time I think about us, "Why can't I remember you?" When I first met you out here in the real world I thought you were a dream come true, only to find out that was the absolute truth.  You are my love, my light and you say we've been dreaming about each other since we were little.
 
So I lay across my bed thinking about you again. Delving behind the locked door that stored my childhood dreams and memories, looking for the answer to the one question that plagued my mind.

I watched the sequences play like a movie in my head...
