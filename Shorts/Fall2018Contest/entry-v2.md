# Why I Can't Remember You
There is  one question I ask myself each time I think about us, "Why can't I remember you?" When I first met you out here in the real world I thought you were a dream come true, only to find out that was the absolute truth.  You are my love, my light and you say we've been dreaming about each other since we were little.
 
So I lay across my bed thinking about you again. Delving behind the locked door that stored my childhood dreams and memories, looking for the answer to the one question that plagues my mind.

I watch the sequences play like a movie in my head... The scene was so familiar I wanted to jump to the next memory but you drew me here, so here I'll stay - for you.

The darkness grew thicker as I watched from my vantage point.  I was afraid of the dark as a child.  I still sleep with a small light on in the bathroom even now.  Did you know that?  The fog rolled in with my demon - my own personal monster.  It whispered what I was thinking, 'monster'.  

No matter how many times I told myself I wasn't a monster, the words my mother said the day I sparked still echoed in my head.  I was a monster.  I thought I was past this, but obviously not.  My dreams echoed my self worth.

I knew what was next and I wanted to turn away to leave this awful memory but I stayed because you drew me here.

I was only watching, as the first blow from the tentacle landed across my back.  "Spark."  My demon yelled.  I bit back the yelp that I felt across my scarred back.  It wasn't real but I felt it none the less.  I hated this.  I wanted to leave and I couldn't take it as I watched another blow land. And then another.  But before I could close my eyes I saw a figure in the darkness.  

A familiar voice echoed through and I didn't need to see his face to know it was you.  "Hey..." You started to say and then your face grew dark and you flung the shadow from my dream.  The demon was gone, the world brightened.  The shadows lifted.  There was only you and me.  

I stood staring at your, relief on my face in both forms, but the younger me, he yelled.  "What are you doing here?"

"I felt you call."  You said.

"You can't be here.  If they find you, if he comes back.  If you are here he'll kill you.  They'll kill you."  I pleaded with you.

You looked at me confused.  I didn't blame you.  This had to be the first time you found out what I was.  "You can't be here."  I pleaded again.  

"Talk to me Nox."  You put your hands on my shoulders and I winched in pain but I didn't shrink from your touch.  

"You're a dream walker.  We kill them.  Alex, on sight.  You can't be here.  If he comes back, he'll find you, and he'll kill you.  You can't come back here, not ever again."

"Nox..."  Your ice blue eyes were sad.  "I don't want to leave you.  What if they don't remember me?  Or you?  I can make them forget.  I can find him, make it even more a dream.  I've done it before."  You said.  

And as I watched I understood.  Why you aren't pissed at me for not remembering, at least not as much as I would expect.  You know deep down.

"I'll make you forget me.  I'll visit, but you won't remember me.  We'll never use our names again, we'll wear different faces.  We'll be someone else - always some one else.  But I can't not come here.  You are my only friend."  You pleaded with me.

"I don't want to forget you."  I was on the verge of tears - then and now.

"We have to.  Nox.  I can't know you are Venatori.  You can't try to remember me.  But I can't lose you."

I gave you a simple nod and you laid your hands on my neck and you pulled me close and you kissed me.  "I love you Nox."  You whispered as the dream faded.  The blackness faded.  The world faded into nothingness of sleep and when I woke up I was standing against the wall with Garrett staring at me.  He glared at me, "You took long enough.  Who was that?"

I shrugged, "I don't know."  I said.  I didn't remember what had happened.  

His glare grew intense, and I shrank beneath it.  He didn't raise his hand but I felt the nudge in my head that said he would if he could.  If there weren't cameras watching.  "Git!"  He said.  And I scrambled away from him.

My heart was racing as I lay on my bed thinking about you.  Thinking about what we did and why.  What happens now.  I know you are real.  I know your name.  My nightmares still take me every night.  Can I protect us both from my people - from the Venatori.  Or now that I know will they hunt you?  I don't have time to be scared.  You give me strength and I know we'll get through this together.
