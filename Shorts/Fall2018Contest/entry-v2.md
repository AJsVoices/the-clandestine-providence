# Why I Can't Remember You
There is  one question I ask myself each time I think about us, "Why can't I remember you?" When I first met you out here in the real world I thought you were a dream come true, only to find out that was the absolute truth.  You are my love, my light and you say we've been dreaming about each other since we were little.
 
So I lay across my bed thinking about you again. Delving behind the locked door that stored my childhood dreams and memories, looking for the answer to the one question that plagued my mind.

I watched the sequences play like a movie in my head... The scene was so familiar I wanted to jump to the next memory but you drew me here, so here I'll stay - for you.

The darkness grew thick.  I was afraid of the dark as a child.  I still sleep with a small light on in the bathroom even now.  Did you know that?  The fog rolled in with my demon - my own personal monster.  It whispered what I was thinking, 'monster'.  

No matter how many times I told myself I wasn't a monster, the words my mother said the day I sparked still echoed in my head.  I was a monster.  I thought I was past this, but obviously not.  My dreams echoed my self worth.

I knew what was next and I wanted to turn away to leave this aweful memory but I stayed because you drew me here.

I was only watching, as the first blow from the tentacle landed across my back.  "Spark."  My demon yelled.  I bit back the yelp that I felt across my scarred back.  It wasn't real but I felt it none the less.
