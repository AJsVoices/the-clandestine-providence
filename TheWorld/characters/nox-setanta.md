## Description:

Nox is 6'0" weighing approximately 145 lbs with a hard to maintain thin athletic build. He has chestnut brown hair with chocolate brown eyes framed with a thick set of eye lashes any woman would die for. He tends to have a few days growth beard mustache carefully managed. Nox almost always has a playful grin plastered on his lips, like everything's a joke to him.

Nox tends to wear eye liner and dyes the tips of his hair in bright colors with matching finger-nail polish. His favorite colors being sapphire blue, crimson red and orange. He has been known to wear flavored lip gloss.

He likes to wear t-shirts with obnoxious sayings, he thinks they are funny and doesn't care if you are offended by them. He always wears a hoodie (pull over or zip up) or a long sleeved shirt. Nox's hands, with his long slender fingers, are the one of the most defined feature he possess other than his eyes and smile.

Nox's body is host to a few scars he's more than willing to tell you a false tale about how he got them. (A vampire bite on his right forearm. Claw marks across his chest from a were-bear, a slash across his left cheek from the dagger of a ghost possessed human, burn on his right leg from knee to ankle from a dragon's flame) And one set he doesn't want to talk about and usually covers up at all times: a series of slash marks across his back from a lifetime of 'self inflicted manifestations of his power in his sleep'. He tends to hide these scares underneath clothing or a personal veil he learned from his first teacher, Garrett.

Nox has a stylized dragon tattoo at the back of his neck just below the base of his skull he got when he was 16. During his Ad Aetatem Nox received his tribal tattoo - a pair of crossed swords at his right temple.

## Personality:

Nox is loud and it can come off as obnoxious. He is almost always ready with a joke or a one liner. He is self-centered, his charm and his attitude tend to get him noticed and he appears to thrive on being center stage. His attitude is infectious but it is also over-the-top and most people tend to take it the wrong way. He makes more enemies than friends.

Nox believes he is not heroic, but his actions speak louder than his words.

Nox enjoys the company of either sex. Despite the numerous conquests he is alone. In an attempt to keep people at a distance Nox flaunts the "I like men" side of his sexuality.

His self centered, jovial, obnoxious behavior is a cover for the anxiety and loneliness he feels inside.

He has a fear of flying, heights/falling and needles and sometimes clowns. Nox has OCPD. He eats nearly the same thing at the same times, he has a set schedule, his routine is nearly unchanged since he was about 7 years old.

## Biography

### Biographical Facts:

Mother: Leanne Sétanta (human) (Born 1966 - 48 in 2015)  
Father: Kai Videns, ENIT4 (Aeternus) (Born 1468 - 547 in 2015)

In 2015 Nox turns 22 years old: Born on Sept 23, 1993  
Born in Boulder, Colorado at the Rocky Mountain Venatori Headquarters

Nox's mother, Leanne Sétanta, was a human hunter among the Venatori, her parents were killed by a rogue werewolf when she was a baby. The Venatori who found her crying and starving in their cabin in the Colorado woods took her in and raised her as one of her own and taught her the way of the Venatori.  Leanne has a twin sister who died then too, she was also bitten by the wolf though she never turned.  [[ Leanne is a rare carrier of Theranthropy. ]]

Kai Viddens has had no wives, and many female companions. He has 6 children, 5 of which he helped raised. Kai found out about Nox when Nox was 18 at his Ad Aetatem. He met Leanne when he was passing through Colorado in 1993 chasing a rogue vampire. Kai was unaware she was human and later became with child. Leanne, and was one of the rare women to survive the birth of Minorem. 

At the age of 5 Nox started showing signs of being a Magnus like his father by starting a random fire. His mother hurriedly dumped Nox on the Venatori for training. He was picked up at the airport by Dorian Vega. At the time of his admittance Nox was designated NNI5 and started his official training early. Garrett Spencer was assigned to be his fire-starter instructor.

Upon arrival at the Apex Unlimited Building in New York City, Nox was tested in all elements. He was found to be capable of bending all 4 elements - he was designated NNIAeTA5.

It was also at this age that Nox started dreaming of a little boy [[ Alex Kennedy ]] in his room full of blocks, he calls him Mushu because he came to him after the first day when he lost his stuffed Mushu dragon to a fire he started because Aaron stole the toy from him.

Garrett finds out about Mushu and tortures him instead of Nox to make Nox spark out of control.  Afterwards Nox begs and pleads with the powers that be, the universe whoever would listen to protect his Mushu from Garrett and the Umbra answered him protecting Mushu from anyone who might ever decide to hurt him.  But in doing so even Nox doesn't remember Mushu.  [[ This action creates Kitsune - the trickster entity Supernatural creatures are wary of ]]

At the age of 6 upon final assessment as a fire-starter Nox created a fire that caught on Garrett's pants and worsened before Nox put it out. This incident was deemed an accident and Nox was held in observation with Dr. Margo Silverman for 3 months and assigned a new mentor, Dae'lin Rivera.

Nox begins to have nightmares of the things Garrett did to him in his mind.

The next 4 years Nox spent his time learning each element bending them individually - fire, air, earth and then water. Dae'lin was routinely frustrated with him.  She insisted upon perfection in everything which made Nox put his nose to the books for all the subjects he faltered in.  Though he managed to pull straight As in everything.

Nox even had time to learn to dance, and to cook, all before the age of 10.

Nox quickly becoming an outsider in The Academy. Nox is continually picked on by Aaron Woolbright (and his friends) another fire-starter like himself. Nox was placed in a room with Aaron and Ross Cortes. Every time a fourth boy was added to the room they promptly left because of the rivalry between Aaron and Nox.

(8 years old) Nox at the suggestion of Margo starts trying to conquer his fear of heights/falling. Nox starts testing various heights and jumping. 

Risk taking was one of the few things that kept Nox going as an outsider, he started doing things that were considered dangerous. His favorite past time was "sky jumping" - vaulting himself from the heights of the buildings with in New York City with only his magic to catch him at the last moment. (This was an effort to defeat his fear of heights/flying) 

Also at 8 years old Nox meets Sage in Margo's office and they become fast friends.  As the weeks go on they begin to include the daughter of Margo's assistant in their games.  Mia leads them on many adventures together throughout their childhood.

(10 years old) During his 5th year at The Academy Nox created a sculpture utilizing all four elements at the same time as an art project for his creativity lessons. This feat named him Cesari. The statue sits in the lobby of the Apex Unlimited Building. He was designated NNC5.

Later that year, per the usual testing requirements, Skill mastery is tested. Nox passed into Adept surpassing most his age. He was designated ANC5. (Dorian preformed the test)

[[ Nox and Alex share their first kiss in the dream ]]

At the age of 13 Nox had his first crush - on another boy. Nox kissed him and Dylan Reed beat Nox to a pulp for the transgression.

[[ Nox and Alex share their first time the dream ]]

A few weeks later, while Nox was watching his crush he was discovered by a girl a few years older, Madison Pratt. She was Nox's first. Nox explores his sexuality almost entirely out of the compound with the occasional dalliance with fellow members of The Academy.

At 15 Nox is caught with Nicholas Hampton in the hall as they are on their way to have sex in Nick's room when Dae'lin catches them and puts an immediate end to any and all relations between them.

[[ Nox and Alex promise to get tattoos representing the other. ]]

At sixteen while trying to fit in Nox found himself with a bunch of guys (his roommates included) getting drunk, daring one another to do stupid things. They dared Nox to get a tattoo. Being drunk was the only thing that allowed him to surpass his fear of needles.
