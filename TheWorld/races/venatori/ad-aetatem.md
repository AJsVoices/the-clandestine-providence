# Ad Aetatem
The Ad Aetatem consists of three parts - first the Venatori child and parents sever ties in a ritualistic ceremony of sacrifice of a small woodland creature and symbolically tying the three together with the intestines of the animal after which an elder cuts them free, severing all bonds. The second is a drug induced vision quest, upon which the child enters a dream like state and views his what is believed to a message from the universe.

The third part is a simple tribal tattoo inked to the right temple - a pair of crossed swords. If during the inking process the child makes a noise, they must wait another year to complete the ritual again.

The Magnus have an additional test is administered first which tests their skill and power levels as if an instructor had given their assent. It is no different than prior test. A Magnus must reach a level of Adept before they are allowed to partake of any other aspects of the Ad Aetatem

Minorem are tested for specific antibodies before being allowed into any progeny program starting after their Ad Aetatem. If criteria are not met then the they are not allowed into the progeny program, and they are sterilized.
